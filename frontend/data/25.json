["<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> In the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, while I was among the exiles by the Chebar Canal, the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God. <sup>2</sup> On the fifth day of the month ​— ​it was the fifth year of King Jehoiachin’s exile ​— ​ <sup>3</sup> the word of the Lord came directly to the priest Ezekiel son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the Chebar Canal. The Lord’s hand was on him there. <sup>4</sup> I looked, and there was a whirlwind coming from the north, a huge cloud with fire flashing back and forth and brilliant light all around it. In the </span>\n    <del>center</del>\n    <ins>centre</ins>\n    <span> of the fire, there was a gleam like amber. <sup>5</sup> The likeness of four living creatures came from it, and this was their appearance: They looked something like a human, <sup>6</sup> but each of them had four faces and four wings. <sup>7</sup> Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the hooves of a calf, sparkling like the gleam of polished bronze. <sup>8</sup> They had human hands under their wings on their four sides. All four of them had faces and wings. <sup>9</sup> Their wings were touching. The creatures did not turn as they moved; each one went straight ahead. <sup>10</sup> Their faces looked something like the face of a human, and each of the four had the face of a lion on the right, the face of an ox on the left, and the face of an eagle. <sup>11</sup> That is what their faces were like. Their wings were spread </span>\n    <del>upward</del>\n    <ins>upwards</ins>\n    <span>; each had two wings touching that of another and two wings covering its body. <sup>12</sup> Each creature went straight ahead. Wherever the Spirit wanted to go, they went without turning as they moved. <sup>13</sup> The likeness of the living creatures was like the appearance of blazing coals of fire or like torches. Fire was moving back and forth between the living creatures; it was bright, with lightning coming out of it. <sup>14</sup> The creatures were darting back and forth like flashes of lightning. <sup>15</sup> When I looked at the living creatures, there was one wheel on the ground beside each of the four-faced creatures. <sup>16</sup> The appearance of the wheels and their craftsmanship was like the gleam of beryl, and all four had the same likeness. Their appearance and craftsmanship was like a wheel within a wheel. <sup>17</sup> When they moved, they went in any of the four directions, without turning as they moved. <sup>18</sup> Their four rims were tall and awe-inspiring, completely covered with eyes. <sup>19</sup> When the living creatures moved, the </span>\n    <del>living creatures moved, the </del>\n    <span>wheels moved beside them, and when the creatures rose from the earth, the wheels also rose. <sup>20</sup> Wherever the Spirit wanted to go, the creatures went in the direction the Spirit was moving. The wheels rose alongside them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. <sup>21</sup> When the creatures moved, the wheels moved; when the creatures stopped, the wheels stopped; and when the creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose alongside them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. <sup>22</sup> Over the heads of the living creatures the likeness of an expanse was spread out. It gleamed like awe-inspiring crystal, <sup>23</sup> and under the expanse their wings extended one </span>\n    <del>toward</del>\n    <ins>towards</ins>\n    <span> another. They each also had two wings covering their bodies. <sup>24</sup> When they moved, I heard the sound of their wings like the roar of a huge torrent, like the voice of the Almighty, and a sound of tumult like the noise of an army. When they stopped, they lowered their wings. <sup>25</sup> A voice came from above the expanse over their heads; when they stopped, they lowered their wings. <sup>26</sup> Something like a throne with the appearance of lapis lazuli was above the expanse over their heads. On the throne, high above, was someone who looked like a human. <sup>27</sup> From what seemed to be his waist up, I saw a gleam like amber, with what looked like fire enclosing it all </span>\n    <del>around</del>\n    <ins>round</ins>\n    <span>. From what seemed to be his waist down, I also saw what looked like fire. There was a brilliant light all around him. <sup>28</sup> The appearance of the brilliant light all around was like that of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day. This was the appearance of the likeness of the Lord’s glory. When I saw it, I fell </span>\n    <del>facedown</del>\n    <ins>face down</ins>\n    <span> and heard a voice speaking. </span>\n  </p>\n","<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> He said to me, “Son of man, stand up on your feet and I will speak with you.” <sup>2</sup> As he spoke to me, the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet, and I listened to the one who was speaking to me. <sup>3</sup> He said to me, “Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites, to the rebellious pagans who have rebelled against me. The Israelites and their ancestors have transgressed against me to this day. <sup>4</sup> The descendants are obstinate and </span>\n    <del>hardhearted</del>\n    <ins>hard-hearted</ins>\n    <span>. I am sending you to them, and you must say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says.’ <sup>5</sup> Whether they listen or refuse to listen ​— ​for they are a rebellious house ​— ​they will know that a prophet has been among them. <sup>6</sup> “But you, son of man, do not be afraid of them and do not be afraid of their words, even though </span>\n    <del>briers</del>\n    <ins>briars</ins>\n    <span> and thorns are beside you and you live among scorpions. Don’t be afraid of their words or discouraged by the look on their faces, for they are a rebellious house. <sup>7</sup> Speak my words to them whether they listen or refuse to listen, for they are rebellious. <sup>8</sup> “And you, son of man, listen to what I tell you: Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat what I am giving you.” <sup>9</sup> So I looked and saw a hand reaching out to me, and there was a written scroll in it. <sup>10</sup> When he unrolled it before me, it was written on the front and back; words of lamentation, mourning, and woe were written on it. </span>\n  </p>\n","<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> He said to me, “Son of man, eat what you find here. Eat this scroll, then go and speak to the house of Israel.” <sup>2</sup> So I opened my mouth, and he fed me the scroll. <sup>3</sup> “Son of man,” he said to me, “feed your stomach and fill your belly with this scroll I am giving you.” So I ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth. <sup>4</sup> Then he said to me, “Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak my words to them. <sup>5</sup> For you are not being sent to a people of unintelligible speech or a difficult language but to the house of Israel — <sup>6</sup> not to the many peoples of unintelligible speech or a difficult language, whose words you cannot understand. No doubt, if I sent you to them, they would listen to you. <sup>7</sup> But the house of Israel will not want to listen to you because they do not want to listen to me. For the whole house of Israel is </span>\n    <del>hardheaded</del>\n    <ins>hard-headed</ins>\n    <span> and </span>\n    <del>hardhearted</del>\n    <ins>hard-hearted</ins>\n    <span>. <sup>8</sup> Look, I have made your face as hard as their faces and your forehead as hard as their foreheads. <sup>9</sup> I have made your forehead like a diamond, harder than flint. Don’t be afraid of them or discouraged by the look on their faces, though they are a rebellious house.” <sup>10</sup> Next he said to me, “Son of man, listen carefully to all my words that I speak to you and take them to heart. <sup>11</sup> Go to your people, the exiles, and speak to them. Tell them, ‘This is what the Lord God says,’ whether they listen or refuse to listen.” <sup>12</sup> The Spirit then lifted me up, and I heard a loud rumbling sound behind me ​— ​bless the glory of the Lord in his place! ​— ​ <sup>13</sup> with the sound of the living creatures’ wings brushing against each other and the sound of the wheels beside them, a loud rumbling sound. <sup>14</sup> The Spirit lifted me up and took me away. I left in bitterness and in an angry spirit, and the Lord’s hand was on me powerfully. <sup>15</sup> I came to the exiles at Tel-abib, who were living by the Chebar Canal, and I sat there among them stunned for seven days. <sup>16</sup> Now at the end of seven days the word of the Lord came to me: <sup>17</sup> “Son of man, I have made you a watchman over the house of Israel. When you hear a word from my mouth, give them a warning from me. <sup>18</sup> If I say to the wicked person, ‘You will surely die,’ but you do not warn him ​— ​you don’t speak out to warn him about his wicked way in order to save his life ​— ​that wicked person will die for his iniquity. Yet I will hold you responsible for his blood. <sup>19</sup> But if you warn a wicked person and he does not turn from his wickedness or his wicked way, he will die for his iniquity, but you will have rescued yourself. <sup>20</sup> Now if a righteous person turns from his righteousness and acts unjustly, and I put a stumbling block in front of him, he will die. If you did not warn him, he will die because of his sin, and the righteous acts he did will not be remembered. Yet I will hold you responsible for his blood. <sup>21</sup> But if you warn the righteous person that he should not sin, and he does not sin, he will indeed live because he listened to your warning, and you will have rescued yourself.” <sup>22</sup> The hand of the Lord was on me there, and he said to me, “Get up, go out to the plain, and I will speak with you there.” <sup>23</sup> So I got up and went out to the plain. The Lord’s glory was present there, like the glory I had seen by the Chebar Canal, and I fell </span>\n    <del>facedown</del>\n    <ins>face down</ins>\n    <span>. <sup>24</sup> The Spirit entered me and set me on my feet. He spoke with me and said, “Go, shut yourself inside your house. <sup>25</sup> As for you, son of man, they will put ropes on you and bind you with them so </span>\n    <ins>that </ins>\n    <span>you cannot go out among them. <sup>26</sup> I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth, and you will be mute and unable to be a mediator for them, for they are a rebellious house. <sup>27</sup> But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you will say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says.’ Let the one who listens, listen, and let the one who refuses, refuse ​— ​for they are a rebellious house. </span>\n  </p>\n","<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> “Now you, son of man, take a brick, set it in front of you, and draw the city of Jerusalem on it. <sup>2</sup> Then lay siege against it: Construct a siege wall, build a ramp, pitch military camps, and place battering rams against it on all sides. <sup>3</sup> Take an iron plate and set it up as an iron wall between yourself and the city. Face it so that it is under siege, and besiege it. This will be a sign for the house of Israel. <sup>4</sup> “Then lie down on your left side and place the iniquity of the house of Israel on it. You will bear their iniquity for the number of days you lie on your side. <sup>5</sup> For I have assigned you the years of their iniquity according to the number of days you lie down, 390 days; so you will bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. <sup>6</sup> When you have completed these days, lie down again, but on your right side, and bear the iniquity of the house of Judah. I have assigned you forty days, a day for each year. <sup>7</sup> Face the siege of Jerusalem with your arm bared, and prophesy against it. <sup>8</sup> Be aware that I will put cords on you so </span>\n    <ins>that </ins>\n    <span>you cannot turn from side to side until you have finished the days of your siege. <sup>9</sup> “Also take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt. Put them in a single container and make them into bread for yourself. You are to eat it during the number of days you lie on your side, 390 days. <sup>10</sup> The food you eat each day will weigh </span>\n    <del>eight ounces</del>\n    <ins>230 grams</ins>\n    <span>; you will eat it at set times. <sup>11</sup> You will also drink a ration of water, </span>\n    <ins>half </ins>\n    <span>a </span>\n    <del>sixth of a gallon</del>\n    <ins>litre</ins>\n    <span>, which you will drink at set times. <sup>12</sup> You will eat it as you would a barley cake and bake it over dried human excrement in their sight.” <sup>13</sup> The Lord said, “This is how the Israelites will eat their bread ​— ​ceremonially unclean ​— ​among the nations where I will banish them.” <sup>14</sup> But I said, “Oh, Lord God, I have never been defiled. From my youth until now I have not eaten anything that died naturally or was mauled by wild beasts. And impure meat has never entered my mouth.” <sup>15</sup> He replied to me, “Look, I will let you use cow dung instead of human excrement, and you can make your bread over that.” <sup>16</sup> He said to me, “Son of man, I am going to cut off the supply of bread in Jerusalem. They will anxiously eat food they have weighed out and in dread drink rationed water <sup>17</sup> for lack of bread and water. Everyone will be devastated and waste away because of their iniquity. </span>\n  </p>\n","<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> “Now you, son of man, take a sharp sword, use it as you would a barber’s razor, and shave your head and beard. Then take a set of scales and divide the hair. <sup>2</sup> You are to burn a third of it in the city when the days of the siege have ended; you are to take a third and slash it with the sword all around the city; and you are to scatter a third to the wind, for I will draw a sword to chase after them. <sup>3</sup> But you are to take a few strands from the hair and secure them in the folds of your robe. <sup>4</sup> Take some more of them, throw them into the fire, and burn them in it. A fire will spread from it to the whole house of Israel. <sup>5</sup> “This is what the Lord God says: I have set this Jerusalem in the </span>\n    <del>center</del>\n    <ins>centre</ins>\n    <span> of the nations, with countries all around her. <sup>6</sup> She has rebelled against my ordinances with more wickedness than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries that surround her. For her people have rejected my ordinances and have not walked in my statutes. <sup>7</sup> “Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: Because you have been more insubordinate than the nations around you ​— ​you have not walked in my statutes or kept my ordinances; you have not even kept the ordinances of the nations around you ​— ​ <sup>8</sup> therefore, this is what the Lord God says: See, I myself am against you, Jerusalem, and I will execute </span>\n    <del>judgments</del>\n    <ins>judgements</ins>\n    <span> within you in the sight of the nations. <sup>9</sup> Because of all your detestable practices, I will do to you what I have never done before and what I will never do again. <sup>10</sup> As a result, fathers will eat their sons within Jerusalem, and sons will eat their fathers. I will execute </span>\n    <del>judgments</del>\n    <ins>judgements</ins>\n    <span> against you and scatter all your survivors to every direction of the wind. <sup>11</sup> “Therefore, as I live” ​— ​this is the declaration of the Lord God ​— ​“I will withdraw and show you no pity, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your abhorrent acts and detestable practices. Yes, I will not spare you. <sup>12</sup> A third of your people will die by plague and be consumed by famine within you; a third will fall by the sword all around you; and I will scatter a third to every direction of the wind, and I will draw a sword to chase after them. <sup>13</sup> When my anger is spent and I have vented my wrath on them, I will be appeased. Then after I have spent my wrath on them, they will know that I, the Lord, have spoken in my jealousy. <sup>14</sup> “I will make you a ruin and a disgrace among the nations around you, in the sight of everyone who passes by. <sup>15</sup> So you will be a disgrace and a taunt, a warning and a horror, to the nations around you when I execute </span>\n    <del>judgments</del>\n    <ins>judgements</ins>\n    <span> against you in anger, wrath, and furious rebukes. I, the Lord, have spoken. <sup>16</sup> When I shoot deadly arrows of famine at them, arrows for destruction that I will send to destroy you, inhabitants of Jerusalem, I will intensify the famine against you and cut off your supply of bread. <sup>17</sup> I will send famine and dangerous animals against you. They will leave you childless. Plague and bloodshed will sweep through you, and I will bring a sword against you. I, the Lord, have spoken.” </span>\n  </p>\n","<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> The word of the Lord came to me: <sup>2</sup> “Son of man, face the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them. <sup>3</sup> You are to say: Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God! This is what the Lord God says to the mountains and the hills, to the ravines and the valleys: I am about to bring a sword against you, and I will destroy your high places. <sup>4</sup> Your altars will be desolated and your shrines smashed. I will throw down your slain in front of your idols. <sup>5</sup> I will lay the corpses of the Israelites in front of their idols and scatter your bones around your altars. <sup>6</sup> Wherever you live the cities will be in ruins and the high places will be desolate, so that your altars will lie in ruins and be desecrated, your idols smashed and obliterated, your shrines cut down, and what you have made wiped out. <sup>7</sup> The slain will fall among you, and you will know that I am the Lord. <sup>8</sup> “Yet I will leave a remnant when you are scattered among the nations, for throughout the countries there will be some of you who will escape the sword. <sup>9</sup> Then your survivors will remember me among the nations where they are taken captive, how I was crushed by their promiscuous hearts that turned away from me and by their eyes that lusted after their idols. They will loathe themselves because of the evil things they did, their detestable actions of every kind. <sup>10</sup> And they will know that I am the Lord; I did not threaten to bring this disaster on them without a reason. <sup>11</sup> “This is what the Lord God says: Clap your hands, stamp your feet, and cry out over all the evil and detestable practices of the house of Israel, who will fall by the sword, famine, and plague. <sup>12</sup> The one who is far off will die by plague; the one who is near will fall by the sword; and the one who remains and is spared will die of famine. In this way I will exhaust my wrath on them. <sup>13</sup> You will all know that I am the Lord when their slain lie among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, and under every green tree and every leafy oak ​— ​the places where they offered pleasing aromas to all their idols. <sup>14</sup> I will stretch out my hand against them, and wherever they live I will make the land a desolate waste, from the wilderness to Riblah. Then they will know that I am the Lord.” </span>\n  </p>\n","<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> The word of the Lord came to me: <sup>2</sup> “Son of man, this is what the Lord God says to the land of Israel: An end! The end has come on the four corners of the earth. <sup>3</sup> The end is now upon you; I will send my anger against you and judge you according to your ways. I will punish you for all your detestable practices. <sup>4</sup> I will not look on you with pity or spare you, but I will punish you for your ways and for your detestable practices within you. Then you will know that I am the Lord.” <sup>5</sup> This is what the Lord God says: Look, one disaster after another is coming! <sup>6</sup> An end has come; the end has come! It has awakened against you. Look, it is coming! <sup>7</sup> Doom has come on you, inhabitants of the land. The time has come; the day is near. There will be panic on the mountains and not celebration. <sup>8</sup> I will pour out my wrath on you very soon; I will exhaust my anger against you and judge you according to your ways. I will punish you for all your detestable practices. <sup>9</sup> I will not look on you with pity or spare you. I will punish you for your ways and for your detestable practices within you. Then you will know that it is I, the Lord, who strikes. <sup>10</sup> Here is the day! Here it comes! Doom is on its way. The rod has blossomed; arrogance has bloomed. <sup>11</sup> Violence has grown into a rod of wickedness. None of them will remain: none of that crowd, none of their wealth, and none of the eminent among them. <sup>12</sup> The time has come; the day has arrived. Let the buyer not rejoice and the seller not mourn, for wrath is on her whole crowd. <sup>13</sup> The seller will certainly not return to what was sold as long as he and the buyer remain alive. For the vision concerning her whole crowd will not be revoked, and because of the iniquity of each one, none will preserve his life. <sup>14</sup> They have blown the trumpet and prepared everything, but no one goes to war, for my wrath is on her whole crowd. <sup>15</sup> The sword is on the outside; plague and famine are on the inside. Whoever is in the field will die by the sword, and famine and plague will devour whoever is in the city. <sup>16</sup> The survivors among them will escape and live on the mountains. Like doves of the valley, all of them will moan, each over his own iniquity. <sup>17</sup> All their hands will become weak, and all their knees will run with urine. <sup>18</sup> They will put on sackcloth, and horror will overwhelm them. Shame will cover all their faces, and all their heads will be bald. <sup>19</sup> They will throw their silver into the streets, and their gold will seem like something filthy. Their silver and gold will be unable to save them in the day of the Lord’s wrath. They will not satisfy their appetites or fill their stomachs, for these were the stumbling blocks that brought about their iniquity. <sup>20</sup> He appointed his beautiful ornaments for majesty, but they made their detestable images from them, their abhorrent things. Therefore, I have made these into something filthy to them. <sup>21</sup> I will hand these things over to foreigners as plunder and to the wicked of the earth as spoil, and they will profane them. <sup>22</sup> I will turn my face from them as they profane my treasured place. Violent men will enter it and profane it. <sup>23</sup> Forge the chain, for the land is filled with crimes of bloodshed, and the city is filled with violence. <sup>24</sup> So I will bring the most evil of nations to take possession of their houses. I will put an end to the pride of the strong, and their sacred places will be profaned. <sup>25</sup> Anguish is coming! They will look for peace, but there will be none. <sup>26</sup> Disaster after disaster will come, and there will be </span>\n    <del>rumor</del>\n    <ins>rumour</ins>\n    <span> after </span>\n    <del>rumor</del>\n    <ins>rumour</ins>\n    <span>. Then they will look for a vision from a prophet, but instruction will perish from the priests and counsel from the elders. <sup>27</sup> The king will mourn; the prince will be clothed in grief; and the hands of the people of the land will tremble. I will deal with them according to their own conduct, and I will judge them by their own standards. Then they will know that I am the Lord. </span>\n  </p>\n","<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> In the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, I was sitting in my house and the elders of Judah were sitting in front of me, and there the hand of the Lord God came down on me. <sup>2</sup> I looked, and there was someone who looked like a man. From what seemed to be his waist down was fire, and from his waist up was something that looked bright, like the gleam of amber. <sup>3</sup> He stretched out what appeared to be a hand and took me by the hair of my head. Then the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and carried me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the inner gate that faces north, where the offensive statue that provokes jealousy was located. <sup>4</sup> I saw the glory of the God of Israel there, like the vision I had seen in the plain. <sup>5</sup> The Lord said to me, “Son of man, look </span>\n    <del>toward</del>\n    <ins>towards</ins>\n    <span> the north.” I looked to the north, and there was this offensive statue north of the Altar Gate, at the entrance. <sup>6</sup> He said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they are doing here ​— ​more detestable acts that the house of Israel is committing ​— ​so that I must depart from my sanctuary? You will see even more detestable acts.” <sup>7</sup> Then he brought me to the entrance of the court, and when I looked there was a hole in the wall. <sup>8</sup> He said to me, “Son of man, dig through the wall.” So I dug through the wall and discovered a doorway. <sup>9</sup> He said to me, “Go in and see the detestable, wicked acts they are committing here.” <sup>10</sup> I went in and looked, and there engraved all </span>\n    <del>around</del>\n    <ins>round</ins>\n    <span> the wall was every kind of abhorrent thing ​— ​crawling creatures and beasts ​— ​as well as all the idols of the house of Israel. <sup>11</sup> Seventy elders from the house of Israel were standing before them, with Jaazaniah son of Shaphan standing among them. Each had a firepan in his hand, and a fragrant cloud of incense was rising up. <sup>12</sup> He said to me, “Son of man, do you see what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the darkness, each at the shrine of his idol? For they are saying, ‘The Lord does not see us. The Lord has abandoned the land.’ ” <sup>13</sup> Again he said to me, “You will see even more detestable acts that they are committing.” <sup>14</sup> Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the Lord’s house, and I saw women sitting there weeping for Tammuz. <sup>15</sup> And he said to me, “Do you see this, son of man? You will see even more detestable acts than these.” <sup>16</sup> So he brought me to the inner court of the Lord’s house, and there were about twenty-five men at the entrance of the Lord’s temple, between the portico and the altar, with their backs to the Lord’s temple and their faces turned to the east. They were bowing to the east in worship of the sun. <sup>17</sup> And he said to me, “Do you see this, son of man? Is it not enough for the house of Judah to commit the detestable acts they are doing here, that they must also fill the land with violence and repeatedly anger me, even putting the branch to their nose? <sup>18</sup> Therefore I will respond with wrath. I will not show pity or spare them. Though they call loudly in my hearing, I will not listen to them.” </span>\n  </p>\n","<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> Then he called loudly in my hearing, “Come near, executioners of the city, each of you with a destructive weapon in his hand.” <sup>2</sup> And I saw six men coming from the direction of the Upper Gate, which faces north, each with a war club in his hand. There was another man among them, clothed in linen, carrying writing equipment. They came and stood beside the bronze altar. <sup>3</sup> Then the glory of the God of Israel rose from above the cherub where it had been, to the threshold of the temple. He called to the man clothed in linen and carrying writing equipment. <sup>4</sup> “Pass throughout the city of Jerusalem,” the Lord said to him, “and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and groan over all the detestable practices committed in it.” <sup>5</sup> He spoke to the others in my hearing: “Pass through the city after him and start killing; do not show pity or spare them! <sup>6</sup> Slaughter the old men, the young men and women, as well as the children and older women, but do not come near anyone who has the mark. Begin at my sanctuary.” So they began with the elders who were in front of the temple. <sup>7</sup> Then he said to them, “Defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain. Go! ” So they went out</span>\n    <ins>, </ins>\n    <span>killing people in the city. <sup>8</sup> While they were killing, I was left alone. And I fell </span>\n    <del>facedown</del>\n    <ins>face down</ins>\n    <span> and cried out, “Oh, Lord God! Are you going to destroy the entire remnant of Israel when you pour out your wrath on Jerusalem? ” <sup>9</sup> He answered me, “The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is extremely great; the land is full of bloodshed, and the city full of perversity. For they say, ‘The Lord has abandoned the land; he does not see.’ <sup>10</sup> But as for me, I will not show pity or spare them. I will bring their conduct down on their own heads.” <sup>11</sup> Then the man clothed in linen and carrying writing equipment reported back, “I have done all that you commanded me.” </span>\n  </p>\n","<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> Then I looked, and there above the expanse over the heads of the cherubim was something like a throne with the appearance of lapis lazuli. <sup>2</sup> The Lord spoke to the man clothed in linen and said, “Go inside the wheelwork beneath the cherubim. Fill your hands with blazing coals from among the cherubim and scatter them over the city.” So he went in as I watched. <sup>3</sup> Now the cherubim were standing to the south of the temple when the man went in, and the cloud filled the inner court. <sup>4</sup> Then the glory of the Lord rose from above the cherub to the threshold of the temple. The temple was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with the brightness of the Lord’s glory. <sup>5</sup> The sound of the cherubim’s wings could be heard as far as the outer court; it was like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks. <sup>6</sup> After the Lord commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, “Take fire from inside the wheelwork, from among the cherubim,” the man went in and stood beside a wheel. <sup>7</sup> Then the cherub reached out his hand to the fire that was among them. He took some and put it into the hands of the man clothed in linen, who took it and went out. <sup>8</sup> The cherubim appeared to have the form of human hands under their wings. <sup>9</sup> I looked, and there were four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside each cherub. The </span>\n    <del>luster</del>\n    <ins>lustre</ins>\n    <span> of the wheels was like the gleam of beryl. <sup>10</sup> In appearance, all four looked alike, like a wheel within a wheel. <sup>11</sup> When they moved, they would go in any of the four directions, without pivoting as they moved. But wherever the head faced, they would go in that direction, without pivoting as they went. <sup>12</sup> Their entire bodies, including their backs, hands, wings, and the wheels that the four of them had, were full of eyes all </span>\n    <del>around</del>\n    <ins>round</ins>\n    <span>. <sup>13</sup> As I listened the wheels were called “the wheelwork</span>\n    <del>.</del>\n    <span>”</span>\n    <ins>. </ins>\n    <span><sup>14</sup> Each one had four faces: one was the face of a cherub, the second the face of a human, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle. <sup>15</sup> The cherubim ascended; these were the living creatures I had seen by the Chebar Canal. <sup>16</sup> When the cherubim moved, the wheels moved beside them, and when they lifted their wings to rise from the earth, even then the wheels did not veer away from them. <sup>17</sup> When the cherubim stopped, the wheels stood still, and when they ascended, the wheels ascended with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in them. <sup>18</sup> Then the glory of the Lord moved away from the threshold of the temple and stopped above the cherubim. <sup>19</sup> The cherubim lifted their wings and ascended from the earth right before my eyes; the wheels were beside them as they went. The glory of the God of Israel was above them, and it stopped at the entrance to the eastern gate of the Lord’s house. <sup>20</sup> These were the living creatures I had seen beneath the God of Israel by the Chebar Canal, and I </span>\n    <del>recognized</del>\n    <ins>recognised</ins>\n    <span> that they were cherubim. <sup>21</sup> Each had four faces and each had four wings, with what looked something like human hands under their wings. <sup>22</sup> Their faces looked like the same faces I had seen by the Chebar Canal. Each creature went straight ahead. </span>\n  </p>\n","<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> The Spirit then lifted me up and brought me to the eastern gate of the Lord’s house, which faces east, and at the gate’s entrance were twenty-five men. Among them I saw Jaazaniah son of Azzur, and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, leaders of the people. <sup>2</sup> The Lord said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who plot evil and give wicked advice in this city. <sup>3</sup> They are saying, ‘Isn’t the time near to build houses? The city is the pot, and we are the meat.’ <sup>4</sup> Therefore, prophesy against them. Prophesy, son of man! ” <sup>5</sup> Then the Spirit of the Lord came on me, and he told me, “You are to say, ‘This is what the Lord says: That is what you are thinking, house of Israel; and I know the thoughts that arise in your mind. <sup>6</sup> You have multiplied your slain in this city, filling its streets with them. <sup>7</sup> “ ‘Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: The slain you have put within it are the meat, and the city is the pot, but I will take you out of it. <sup>8</sup> You fear the sword, so I will bring the sword against you. This is the declaration of the Lord God. <sup>9</sup> I will take you out of the city and hand you over to foreigners; I will execute </span>\n    <del>judgments</del>\n    <ins>judgements</ins>\n    <span> against you. <sup>10</sup> You will fall by the sword, and I will judge you at the border of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord. <sup>11</sup> The city will not be a pot for you, and you will not be the meat within it. I will judge you at the border of Israel, <sup>12</sup> so </span>\n    <ins>that </ins>\n    <span>you will know that I am the Lord, whose statutes you have not followed and whose ordinances you have not </span>\n    <del>practiced</del>\n    <ins>practised</ins>\n    <span>. Instead, you have acted according to the ordinances of the nations around you.’ ” <sup>13</sup> Now while I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I fell </span>\n    <del>facedown</del>\n    <ins>face down</ins>\n    <span> and cried out loudly, “Oh, Lord God! You are bringing the remnant of Israel to an end! ” <sup>14</sup> The word of the Lord came to me again: <sup>15</sup> “Son of man, your own relatives, those who have the right to redeem your property, along with the entire house of Israel ​— ​all of them ​— ​are those to whom the residents of Jerusalem have said, ‘You are far from the Lord; this land has been given to us as a possession.’ <sup>16</sup> “Therefore say, ‘This is what the Lord God says: Though I sent them far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries, yet for a little while I have been a sanctuary for them in the countries where they have gone.’ <sup>17</sup> “Therefore say, ‘This is what the Lord God says: I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.’ <sup>18</sup> “When they arrive there, they will remove all its abhorrent acts and detestable practices from it. <sup>19</sup> I will give them integrity of heart and put a new spirit within them; I will remove their heart of stone from their bodies and give them a heart of flesh, <sup>20</sup> so that they will follow my statutes, keep my ordinances, and </span>\n    <del>practice</del>\n    <ins>practise</ins>\n    <span> them. They will be my people, and I will be their God. <sup>21</sup> But as for those whose hearts pursue their desire for abhorrent acts and detestable practices, I will bring their conduct down on their own heads.” This is the declaration of the Lord God. <sup>22</sup> Then the cherubim, with the wheels beside them, lifted their wings, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them. <sup>23</sup> The glory of the Lord rose up from within the city and stopped on the mountain east of the city. <sup>24</sup> The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to Chaldea and to the exiles in a vision from the Spirit of God. After the vision I had seen left me, <sup>25</sup> I spoke to the exiles about all the things the Lord had shown me. </span>\n  </p>\n","<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> The word of the Lord came to me: <sup>2</sup> “Son of man, you are living among a rebellious house. They have eyes to see but do not see, and ears to hear but do not hear, for they are a rebellious house. <sup>3</sup> “Now you, son of man, get your bags ready for exile and go into exile in their sight during the day. You will go into exile from your place to another place while they watch; perhaps they will understand, though they are a rebellious house. <sup>4</sup> During the day, bring out your bags like an exile’s bags while they look on. Then in the evening go out in their sight like those going into exile. <sup>5</sup> As they watch, dig through the wall and take the bags out through it. <sup>6</sup> And while they look on, lift the bags to your shoulder and take them out in the dark; cover your face so that you cannot see the land. For I have made you a sign to the house of Israel.” <sup>7</sup> So I did just as I was commanded. In the daytime I brought out my bags like an exile’s bags. In the evening I dug through the wall by hand; I took them out in the dark, carrying them on my shoulder in their sight. <sup>8</sup> In the morning the word of the Lord came to me: <sup>9</sup> “Son of man, hasn’t the house of Israel, that rebellious house, asked you, ‘What are you doing? ’ <sup>10</sup> Say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: This pronouncement concerns the prince in Jerusalem and the whole house of Israel living there.’ <sup>11</sup> You are to say, ‘I am a sign for you. Just as I have done, it will be done to them; they will go into exile, into captivity.’ <sup>12</sup> The prince who is among them will lift his bags to his shoulder in the dark and go out. They will dig through the wall to bring him out through it. He will cover his face so </span>\n    <ins>that </ins>\n    <span>he cannot see the land with his eyes. <sup>13</sup> But I will spread my net over him, and he will be caught in my snare. I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, yet he will not see it, and he will die there. <sup>14</sup> I will also scatter all the attendants who surround him and all his troops to every direction of the wind, and I will draw a sword to chase after them. <sup>15</sup> They will know that I am the Lord when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them among the countries. <sup>16</sup> But I will spare a few of them from the sword, famine, and plague, so that among the nations where they go they can tell about all their detestable practices. Then they will know that I am the Lord.” <sup>17</sup> The word of the Lord came to me: <sup>18</sup> “Son of man, eat your bread with trembling and drink your water with anxious shaking. <sup>19</sup> Then say to the people of the land, ‘This is what the Lord God says about the residents of Jerusalem in the land of Israel: They will eat their bread with anxiety and drink their water in dread, for their land will be stripped of everything in it because of the violence of all who live there. <sup>20</sup> The inhabited cities will be destroyed, and the land will become dreadful. Then you will know that I am the Lord.’ ” <sup>21</sup> Again the word of the Lord came to me: <sup>22</sup> “Son of man, what is this proverb you people have about the land of Israel, which goes, ‘The days keep passing by, and every vision fails’? <sup>23</sup> Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: I will put a stop to this proverb, and they will not use it again in Israel.’ But say to them, ‘The days have arrived, as well as the </span>\n    <del>fulfillment</del>\n    <ins>fulfilment</ins>\n    <span> of every vision. <sup>24</sup> For there will no longer be any false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel. <sup>25</sup> But I, the Lord, will speak whatever message I will speak, and it will be done. It will no longer be delayed. For in your days, rebellious house, I will speak a message and bring it to pass. This is the declaration of the Lord God.’ ” <sup>26</sup> The word of the Lord came to me: <sup>27</sup> “Son of man, notice that the house of Israel is saying, ‘The vision that he sees concerns many years from now; he prophesies about distant times.’ <sup>28</sup> Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: None of my words will be delayed any longer. The message I speak will be fulfilled. This is the declaration of the Lord God.’ ” </span>\n  </p>\n","<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> The word of the Lord came to me: <sup>2</sup> “Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who are prophesying. Say to those who prophesy out of their own imagination, ‘Hear the word of the Lord! <sup>3</sup> This is what the Lord God says: Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing. <sup>4</sup> Your prophets, Israel, are like jackals among ruins. <sup>5</sup> You did not go up to the gaps or restore the wall </span>\n    <del>around</del>\n    <ins>round</ins>\n    <span> the house of Israel so that it might stand in battle on the day of the Lord. <sup>6</sup> They saw false visions and their divinations were a lie.

This is the declaration of the Lord God. <sup>9</sup> My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and speak lying divinations. They will not be present in the council of my people or be recorded in the register of the house of Israel, and they will not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord God. <sup>10</sup> “ ‘Since they have led my people astray by saying, “Peace,” when there is no peace, and since when a flimsy wall is being built, they plaster it with whitewash, <sup>11</sup> therefore, tell those plastering it with whitewash that it will fall. Torrential rain will come, and I will send hailstones plunging down, and a whirlwind will be released. <sup>12</sup> When the wall has fallen, will you not be asked, “Where’s the whitewash you plastered on it? ” <sup>13</sup> “ ‘So this is what the Lord God says: I will release a whirlwind in my wrath. Torrential rain will come in my anger, and hailstones will fall in destructive fury. <sup>14</sup> I will demolish the wall you plastered with whitewash and knock it to the ground so that its foundation is exposed. The city will fall, and you will be destroyed within it. Then you will know that I am the Lord. <sup>15</sup> After I exhaust my wrath against the wall and against those who plaster it with whitewash, I will say to you, “The wall is no more and neither are those who plastered it ​— ​ <sup>16</sup> those prophets of Israel who prophesied to Jerusalem and saw a vision of peace for her when there was no peace.” This is the declaration of the Lord God.’ <sup>17</sup> “Now you, son of man, face the women among your people who prophesy out of their own imagination, and prophesy against them. <sup>18</sup> Say, ‘This is what the Lord God says: Woe to the women who sew magic bands on the wrist of every hand and who make veils for the heads of people of every size in order to ensnare lives. Will you ensnare the lives of my people but preserve your own? <sup>19</sup> You profane me among my people for handfuls of barley and scraps of bread; you put those to death who should not die and spare those who should not live, when you lie to my people, who listen to lies. <sup>20</sup> “ ‘Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: I am against your magic bands with which you ensnare people like birds, and I will tear them from your arms.

Their breasts were fondled there, and their virgin nipples caressed. <sup>4</sup> The </span>\n    <del>older</del>\n    <ins>elder</ins>\n    <span> one was named Oholah, and her sister was Oholibah. They became mine and gave birth to sons and daughters. As for their names, Oholah represents Samaria and Oholibah represents Jerusalem. <sup>5</sup> “Oholah acted like a prostitute even though she was mine. She lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians: warriors <sup>6</sup> dressed in blue, governors and prefects, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on steeds. <sup>7</sup> She offered her sexual </span>\n    <del>favors</del>\n    <ins>favours</ins>\n    <span> to them; all of them were the elite of Assyria. She defiled herself with all those she lusted after and with all their idols. <sup>8</sup> She didn’t give up her promiscuity that began in Egypt, when men slept with her in her youth, caressed her virgin nipples, and poured out their lust on her. <sup>9</sup> Therefore, I handed her over to her lovers, the Assyrians she lusted for. <sup>10</sup> They exposed her nakedness, seized her sons and daughters, and killed her with the sword. Since they executed </span>\n    <del>judgment</del>\n    <ins>judgement</ins>\n    <span> against her, she became notorious among women. <sup>11</sup> “Now her sister Oholibah saw this, but she was even more depraved in her lust than Oholah, and made her promiscuous acts worse than those of her sister. <sup>12</sup> She lusted after the Assyrians: governors and prefects, warriors splendidly dressed, horsemen riding on steeds, all of them desirable young men. <sup>13</sup> And I saw that she had defiled herself; both of them had taken the same path. <sup>14</sup> But she increased her promiscuity when she saw male figures carved on the wall, images of the Chaldeans, engraved in bright red, <sup>15</sup> wearing belts on their waists and flowing turbans on their heads; all of them looked like officers, a depiction of the Babylonians in Chaldea, their native land. <sup>16</sup> At the sight of them she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea. <sup>17</sup> Then the Babylonians came to her, to the bed of love, and defiled her with their lust. But after she was defiled by them, she turned away from them in disgust. <sup>18</sup> When she flaunted her promiscuity and exposed her nakedness, I turned away from her in disgust just as I turned away from her sister. <sup>19</sup> Yet she multiplied her acts of promiscuity, remembering the days of her youth when she acted like a prostitute in the land of Egypt <sup>20</sup> and lusted after their lovers, whose sexual members were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of stallions. <sup>21</sup> So you revisited the depravity of your youth, when the Egyptians caressed your nipples to enjoy your youthful breasts. <sup>22</sup> “Therefore, Oholibah, this is what the Lord God says: I am going to incite your lovers against you, those you turned away from in disgust. I will bring them against you from every side: <sup>23</sup> the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans; Pekod, Shoa, and Koa; and all the Assyrians with them ​— ​desirable young men, all of them governors and prefects, officers and administrators, all of them riding on steeds. <sup>24</sup> They will come against you with an assembly of peoples and with weapons, chariots, and </span>\n    <del>wagons</del>\n    <ins>carts</ins>\n    <span>. They will set themselves against you on every side with large and small shields and helmets. I will delegate </span>\n    <del>judgment</del>\n    <ins>judgement</ins>\n    <span> to them, and they will judge you by their own standards. <sup>25</sup> When I vent my jealous fury on you, they will deal with you in wrath. They will cut off your nose and ears, and the rest of you will fall by the sword. They will seize your sons and daughters, and the rest of you will be consumed by fire. <sup>26</sup> They will strip off your clothes and take your beautiful </span>\n    <del>jewelry</del>\n    <ins>jewellery</ins>\n    <span>. <sup>27</sup> So I will put an end to your depravity and sexual immorality, which began in the land of Egypt, and you will not look longingly at them or remember Egypt </span>\n    <del>anymore</del>\n    <ins>any more</ins>\n    <span>. <sup>28</sup> “For this is what the Lord God says: I am going to hand you over to those you hate, to those you turned away from in disgust. <sup>29</sup> They will treat you with hatred, take all you have worked for, and leave you stark naked, so that the shame of your debauchery will be exposed, both your depravity and promiscuity. <sup>30</sup> These things will be done to you because you acted like a prostitute with the nations, defiling yourself with their idols. <sup>31</sup> You have followed the path of your sister, so I will put her cup in your hand.” <sup>32</sup> This is what the Lord God says: “You will drink your sister’s cup, which is deep and wide. You will be an object of ridicule and scorn, for it holds so much. <sup>33</sup> You will be filled with drunkenness and grief, with a cup of devastation and desolation, the cup of your sister Samaria. <sup>34</sup> You will drink it and drain it; then you will gnaw its broken pieces, and tear your breasts. For I have spoken.” This is the declaration of the Lord God. <sup>35</sup> Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: “Because you have forgotten me and cast me behind your back, you must bear the consequences of your indecency and promiscuity.” <sup>36</sup> Then the Lord said to me, “Son of man, will you pass </span>\n    <del>judgment</del>\n    <ins>judgement</ins>\n    <span> against Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare their detestable practices to them. <sup>37</sup> For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands; they have committed adultery with their idols. And the children they bore to me they have sacrificed in the fire as food for the idols. <sup>38</sup> They also did this to me: they defiled my sanctuary on that same day and profaned my Sabbaths. <sup>39</sup> On the same day they slaughtered their children for their idols, they entered my sanctuary to profane it. Yes, that is what they did inside my house. <sup>40</sup> “In addition, they sent for men who came from far away when a messenger was dispatched to them. And look how they came! You bathed, painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with </span>\n    <del>jewelry</del>\n    <ins>jewellery</ins>\n    <span> for them. <sup>41</sup> You sat on a luxurious couch with a table spread before it, on which you had set my incense and oil. <sup>42</sup> The sound of a carefree crowd was there. Drunkards from the desert were brought in, along with common men. They put bracelets on the women’s hands and beautiful tiaras on their heads. <sup>43</sup> Then I said concerning this woman worn out by adultery: Will they now have illicit sex with her, even her? <sup>44</sup> Yet they had sex with her as one does with a prostitute. This is how they had sex with Oholah and Oholibah, those depraved women. <sup>45</sup> But righteous men will judge them the way adulteresses and those who shed blood are judged, for they are adulteresses and blood is on their hands. <sup>46</sup> “This is what the Lord God says: Summon an assembly against them and consign them to terror and plunder. <sup>47</sup> The assembly will stone them and cut them down with their swords. They will kill their sons and daughters and burn their houses. <sup>48</sup> So I will put an end to depravity in the land, and all the women will be admonished not to imitate your depraved </span>\n    <del>behavior</del>\n    <ins>behaviour</ins>\n    <span>. <sup>49</sup> They will punish you for your depravity, and you will bear the consequences for your sins of idolatry. Then you will know that I am the Lord God.” </span>\n  </p>\n","<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> The word of the Lord came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month: <sup>2</sup> “Son of man, write down today’s date, this very day. The king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day. <sup>3</sup> Now speak a parable to the rebellious house. Tell them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: Put the pot on the fire — put it on, and then pour water into it! <sup>4</sup> Place the pieces of meat in it, every good piece — thigh and shoulder. Fill it with choice bones. <sup>5</sup> Take the choicest of the flock and also pile up the fuel under it. Bring it to a boil and cook the bones in it. <sup>6</sup> “ ‘Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: Woe to the city of bloodshed, the pot that has corrosion inside it, and its corrosion has not come out of it! Empty it piece by piece; lots should not be cast for its contents. <sup>7</sup> For the blood she shed is still within her. She put it out on the bare rock; she didn’t pour it on the ground to cover it with dust. <sup>8</sup> In order to stir up wrath and take vengeance, I have put her blood on the bare rock, so that it would not be covered. <sup>9</sup> “ ‘Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: Woe to the city of bloodshed! I myself will make the pile of kindling large. <sup>10</sup> Pile on the logs and kindle the fire! Cook the meat well and mix in the spices! Let the bones be burned! <sup>11</sup> Set the empty pot on its coals so that it becomes hot and its copper glows. Then its impurity will melt inside it; its corrosion will be consumed. <sup>12</sup> It has frustrated every effort; its thick corrosion will not come off. Into the fire with its corrosion! <sup>13</sup> Because of the depravity of your uncleanness — since I tried to purify you, but you would not be purified from your uncleanness — you will not be pure again until I have satisfied my wrath on you. <sup>14</sup> I, the Lord, have spoken. It is coming, and I will do it! I will not refrain, I will not show pity, and I will not relent. I will judge you according to your ways and deeds. This is the declaration of the Lord God.’ ” <sup>15</sup> Then the word of the Lord came to me: <sup>16</sup> “Son of man, I am about to take the delight of your eyes away from you with a fatal blow. But you must not lament or weep or let your tears flow. <sup>17</sup> Groan quietly; do not observe mourning rites for the dead. Put on your turban and strap your sandals on your feet; do not cover your </span>\n    <del>mustache</del>\n    <ins>moustache</ins>\n    <span> or eat the bread of mourners.” <sup>18</sup> I spoke to the people in the morning, and my wife died in the evening. The next morning I did just as I was commanded. <sup>19</sup> Then the people asked me, “Won’t you tell us what these things you are doing mean for us? ” <sup>20</sup> So I answered them, “The word of the Lord came to me: <sup>21</sup> Say to the house of Israel, ‘This is what the Lord God says: I am about to desecrate my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the delight of your eyes, and the desire of your heart. Also, the sons and daughters you left behind will fall by the sword. <sup>22</sup> Then you will do just as I have done: You will not cover your </span>\n    <del>mustache</del>\n    <ins>moustache</ins>\n    <span> or eat the bread of mourners. <sup>23</sup> Your turbans will remain on your heads and your sandals on your feet.

When this happens, you will know that I am the Lord God.’ <sup>25</sup> “As for you, son of man, know that on that day I will take from them their stronghold ​— ​their pride and joy, the delight of their eyes, and the longing of their hearts ​— ​as well as their sons and daughters. <sup>26</sup> On that day a fugitive will come to you and report the news. <sup>27</sup> On that day your mouth will be opened to talk with him; you will speak and no longer be mute. So you will be a sign for them, and they will know that I am the Lord.” Prophecies Against the Nations </span>\n  </p>\n","<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> Then the word of the Lord came to me: <sup>2</sup> “Son of man, face the Ammonites and prophesy against them. <sup>3</sup> Say to the Ammonites, ‘Hear the word of the Lord God: This is what the Lord God says: Because you said, “Aha! ” about my sanctuary when it was desecrated, about the land of Israel when it was laid waste, and about the house of Judah when they went into exile, <sup>4</sup> therefore I am about to give you to the people of the east as a possession. They will set up their encampments and pitch their tents among you. They will eat your fruit and drink your milk. <sup>5</sup> I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels and Ammon a resting place for sheep. Then you will know that I am the Lord. <sup>6</sup> “ ‘For this is what the Lord God says: Because you clapped your hands, stamped your feet, and rejoiced over the land of Israel with wholehearted contempt, <sup>7</sup> therefore I am about to stretch out my hand against you and give you as plunder to the nations.

I will destroy you, and you will know that I am the Lord. <sup>8</sup> “ ‘This is what the Lord God says: Because Moab and Seir said, “Look, the house of Judah is like all the other nations.” <sup>9</sup> Therefore I am about to expose Moab’s flank</span>\n    <ins>, </ins>\n    <span>beginning with its frontier cities, the </span>\n    <del>splendor</del>\n    <ins>splendour</ins>\n    <span> of the land: Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim. <sup>10</sup> I will give it along with Ammon to the people of the east as a possession, so that Ammon will not be remembered among the nations. <sup>11</sup> So I will execute </span>\n    <del>judgments</del>\n    <ins>judgements</ins>\n    <span> against Moab, and they will know that I am the Lord. <sup>12</sup> “ ‘This is what the Lord God says: Because Edom acted vengefully against the house of Judah and incurred grievous guilt by taking revenge on them, <sup>13</sup> therefore this is what the Lord God says: I will stretch out my hand against Edom and cut off both people and animals from it. I will make it a wasteland; they will fall by the sword from Teman to Dedan. <sup>14</sup> I will take my vengeance on Edom through my people Israel, and they will deal with Edom according to my anger and wrath.

I will raise up many nations against you, just as the sea raises its waves. <sup>4</sup> They will destroy the walls of Tyre and demolish her towers.

Thirty chambers faced the pavement, <sup>18</sup> which flanked the courtyard’s gates and corresponded to the length of the gates; this was the lower pavement. <sup>19</sup> Then he measured the distance from the front of the lower gate to the exterior front of the inner court; it was </span>\n    <del>175 feet</del>\n    <ins>53 metres</ins>\n    <span>. This was the east; next the north is described. <sup>20</sup> He measured the gate of the outer court facing north, both its length and width. <sup>21</sup> Its three recesses on each side, its jambs, and its portico had the same measurements as the first gate: </span>\n    <del>87 1 /2 feet</del>\n    <ins>26.5 metres</ins>\n    <span> long and </span>\n    <del>43 3 /4 feet</del>\n    <ins>13.25 metres</ins>\n    <span> wide. <sup>22</sup> Its windows, portico, and palm trees had the same measurements as those of the gate that faced east. Seven steps led up to the gate, and its portico was ahead of them. <sup>23</sup> The inner court had a gate facing the north gate, like the one on the east. He measured the distance from gate to gate; it was </span>\n    <del>175 feet</del>\n    <ins>53 metres</ins>\n    <span>. <sup>24</sup> He brought me to the south side, and there was also a gate on the south.

It also had windows all </span>\n    <del>around</del>\n    <ins>round</ins>\n    <span>.

Its stairway had eight steps. <sup>38</sup> There was a chamber whose door opened into the gate’s portico. The burnt offering was to be washed there. <sup>39</sup> Inside the gate’s portico there were two tables on each side, on which to slaughter the burnt offering, sin offering, and guilt offering. <sup>40</sup> Outside, as one approaches the entrance of the north gate, there were two tables on one side and two more tables on the other side of the gate’s portico. <sup>41</sup> So there were four tables inside the gate and four outside, eight tables in all on which the slaughtering was to be done. <sup>42</sup> There were also four tables of cut stone for the burnt offering, each </span>\n    <del>31 1 /2 inches</del>\n    <ins>eighty centimetres</ins>\n    <span> long, </span>\n    <del>31 1 /2 inches</del>\n    <ins>eighty centimetres</ins>\n    <span> wide, and </span>\n    <del>21 inches</del>\n    <ins>fifty-three centimetres</ins>\n    <span> high.

These are the sons of Zadok, the ones from the sons of Levi who may approach the Lord to serve him.” <sup>47</sup> Next he measured the court. It was square, </span>\n    <del>175 feet</del>\n    <ins>53 metres</ins>\n    <span> long and </span>\n    <del>175 feet</del>\n    <ins>53 metres</ins>\n    <span> wide. The altar was in front of the temple. <sup>48</sup> Then he brought me to the portico of the temple and measured the jambs of the portico; they were </span>\n    <del>8 3 / 4 feet</del>\n    <ins>2.65 metres</ins>\n    <span> thick on each side. The width of the gate was </span>\n    <del>24 1 /2 feet</del>\n    <ins>7.4 metres</ins>\n    <span>, and the side walls of the gate were </span>\n    <del>5 </del>\n    <span>1</span>\n    <del> /4 feet</del>\n    <ins>.6 metres</ins>\n    <span> wide on each side. <sup>49</sup> The portico was </span>\n    <del>35 feet</del>\n    <ins>10.6 metres</ins>\n    <span> across and </span>\n    <del>21 feet</del>\n    <ins>6.4 metres</ins>\n    <span> deep, and 10 steps led up to it. There were pillars by the jambs, one on each side. </span>\n  </p>\n","<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> Next he brought me into the great hall and measured the jambs; on each side the width of the jamb was </span>\n    <del>10 1 /</del>\n    <ins>3.</ins>\n    <span>2 </span>\n    <del>feet</del>\n    <ins>metres</ins>\n    <span>. <sup>2</sup> The width of the entrance was </span>\n    <del>17 1 /2 feet</del>\n    <ins>5.3 metres</ins>\n    <span>, and the side walls of the entrance were </span>\n    <del>8 3 /4 feet</del>\n    <ins>2.65 metres</ins>\n    <span> wide on each side. He also measured the length of the great hall, </span>\n    <del>70 feet</del>\n    <ins>21.2 metres</ins>\n    <span>, and the width, </span>\n    <del>35 feet</del>\n    <ins>10</ins>\n    <span>.</span>\n    <ins>6 metres. </ins>\n    <span><sup>3</sup> He went inside the next room and measured the jambs at the entrance; they were </span>\n    <del>3 </del>\n    <span>1 </span>\n    <del>/2 feet</del>\n    <ins>metre</ins>\n    <span> wide.

There were ledges on the wall of the temple all </span>\n    <del>around</del>\n    <ins>round</ins>\n    <span> to serve as supports for the side rooms, so that the supports would not be in the temple wall itself. <sup>7</sup> The side rooms surrounding the temple widened at each successive </span>\n    <del>story</del>\n    <ins>storey</ins>\n    <span>, for the structure surrounding the temple went up by stages. This was the reason for the temple’s broadness as it rose. And so, one would go up from the lowest </span>\n    <del>story</del>\n    <ins>storey</ins>\n    <span> to the highest by means of the middle one. <sup>8</sup> I saw that the temple had a raised platform surrounding it; this foundation for the side rooms was </span>\n    <del>10 1 / </del>\n    <ins>3.</ins>\n    <span>2 </span>\n    <del>feet</del>\n    <ins>metres</ins>\n    <span> high. <sup>9</sup> The thickness of the outer wall of the side rooms was </span>\n    <del>8 3 /4 feet</del>\n    <ins>2</ins>\n    <span>.</span>\n    <ins>65 metres. </ins>\n    <span>The free space between the side rooms of the temple <sup>10</sup> and the outer chambers was </span>\n    <del>35 feet</del>\n    <ins>10.6 metres</ins>\n    <span> wide all </span>\n    <del>around</del>\n    <ins>round</ins>\n    <span> the temple. <sup>11</sup> The side rooms opened into the free space, one entrance </span>\n    <del>toward</del>\n    <ins>towards</ins>\n    <span> the north and another to the south. The area of free space was </span>\n    <del>8 3 /4 feet</del>\n    <ins>2.65 metres</ins>\n    <span> wide all </span>\n    <del>around</del>\n    <ins>round</ins>\n    <span>. <sup>12</sup> Now the building that faced the temple yard </span>\n    <del>toward</del>\n    <ins>towards</ins>\n    <span> the west was </span>\n    <del>122 1 /2 feet</del>\n    <ins>37 metres</ins>\n    <span> wide. The wall of the building was </span>\n    <del>8 3 /4 feet</del>\n    <ins>2.65 metres</ins>\n    <span> thick on all sides, and the building’s length was </span>\n    <del>157 1 /2 feet</del>\n    <ins>48 metres</ins>\n    <span>. <sup>13</sup> Then the man measured the temple; it was </span>\n    <del>175 feet</del>\n    <ins>53 metres</ins>\n    <span> long. In addition, the temple yard and the building, including its walls, were </span>\n    <del>175 feet</del>\n    <ins>53 metres</ins>\n    <span> long. <sup>14</sup> The width of the front of the temple along with the temple yard to the east was </span>\n    <del>175 feet</del>\n    <ins>53 metres</ins>\n    <span>. <sup>15</sup> Next he measured the length of the building facing the temple yard to the west, with its galleries on each side; it was </span>\n    <del>175 feet</del>\n    <ins>53 metres</ins>\n    <span>. The interior of the great hall and the porticoes of the court ​— ​ <sup>16</sup> the thresholds, the </span>\n    <del>beveled</del>\n    <ins>bevelled</ins>\n    <span> windows, and the balconies all </span>\n    <del>around</del>\n    <ins>round</ins>\n    <span> with their three levels opposite the threshold ​— ​were overlaid with wood on all sides. They were </span>\n    <del>paneled</del>\n    <ins>panelled</ins>\n    <span> from the ground to the windows (but the windows were covered), <sup>17</sup> reaching to the top of the entrance, and as far as the inner temple and on the outside. On every wall all </span>\n    <del>around</del>\n    <ins>round</ins>\n    <span>, on the inside and outside, was a pattern <sup>18</sup> carved with cherubim and palm trees. There was a palm tree between each pair of cherubim. Each cherub had two faces: <sup>19</sup> a human face turned </span>\n    <del>toward</del>\n    <ins>towards</ins>\n    <span> the palm tree on one side, and a lion’s face turned </span>\n    <del>toward</del>\n    <ins>towards</ins>\n    <span> it on the other. They were carved throughout the temple on all sides. <sup>20</sup> Cherubim and palm trees were carved from the ground to the top of the entrance and on the wall of the great hall. <sup>21</sup> The doorposts of the great hall were square, and the front of the sanctuary had the same appearance. <sup>22</sup> The altar was made of wood, </span>\n    <del>5 </del>\n    <span>1</span>\n    <del> /4 feet</del>\n    <ins>.6 metres</ins>\n    <span> high and </span>\n    <del>3 </del>\n    <span>1</span>\n    <del> /2 feet</del>\n    <ins>.1 metres</ins>\n    <span> long. It had corners, and its length and sides were of wood. The man told me, “This is the table that stands before the Lord.” <sup>23</sup> The great hall and the sanctuary each had a double door, <sup>24</sup> and each of the doors had two swinging panels. There were two panels for one door and two for the other. <sup>25</sup> Cherubim and palm trees were carved on the doors of the great hall like those carved on the walls. There was a wooden canopy outside, in front of the portico. <sup>26</sup> There were </span>\n    <del>beveled</del>\n    <ins>bevelled</ins>\n    <span> windows and palm trees on both sides, on the side walls of the portico, the side rooms of the temple, and the canopies. </span>\n  </p>\n","<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> Then the man led me out by way of the north gate into the outer court. He brought me to the group of chambers opposite the temple yard and opposite the building to the north. <sup>2</sup> Along the length of the chambers, which was </span>\n    <del>175 feet</del>\n    <ins>53 metres</ins>\n    <span>, there was an entrance on the north; the width was </span>\n    <del>87 1 /2 feet</del>\n    <ins>26</ins>\n    <span>.</span>\n    <ins>5 metres. </ins>\n    <span><sup>3</sup> Opposite the </span>\n    <del>35 foot</del>\n    <ins>10.6 metre</ins>\n    <span> space belonging to the inner court and opposite the paved surface belonging to the outer court, the structure rose gallery by gallery in three tiers. <sup>4</sup> In front of the chambers was a walkway </span>\n    <del>toward</del>\n    <ins>towards</ins>\n    <span> the inside, </span>\n    <del>17 1 /2 feet</del>\n    <ins>5.3 metres</ins>\n    <span> wide and </span>\n    <del>175 feet</del>\n    <ins>53 metres</ins>\n    <span> long, and their entrances were on the north. <sup>5</sup> The upper chambers were narrower because the galleries took away more space from them than from the lower and middle stories of the building. <sup>6</sup> For they were arranged in three stories and had no pillars like the pillars of the courts; therefore the upper chambers were set back from the ground more than the lower and middle stories. <sup>7</sup> A wall on the outside ran in front of the chambers, parallel to them, </span>\n    <del>toward</del>\n    <ins>towards</ins>\n    <span> the outer court; it was </span>\n    <del>87 1 / 2 feet</del>\n    <ins>26.5 metres</ins>\n    <span> long. <sup>8</sup> For the chambers on the outer court were </span>\n    <del>87 1 /2 feet</del>\n    <ins>26.5 metres</ins>\n    <span> long, while those facing the great hall were </span>\n    <del>175 feet</del>\n    <ins>53 metres</ins>\n    <span> long. <sup>9</sup> At the base of these chambers there was an </span>\n    <del>entryway</del>\n    <ins>entrance</ins>\n    <span> on the east side as one enters them from the outer court. <sup>10</sup> In the thickness of the wall of the court </span>\n    <del>toward</del>\n    <ins>towards</ins>\n    <span> the south, there were chambers facing the temple yard and the western building, <sup>11</sup> with a passageway in front of them, just like the chambers that faced north. Their length and width, as well as all their exits, measurements, and entrances, were identical. <sup>12</sup> The entrance at the beginning of the passageway, the way in front of the corresponding wall as one enters on the east side, was similar to the entrances of the chambers that were on the south side. <sup>13</sup> Then the man said to me, “The northern and southern chambers that face the courtyard are the holy chambers where the priests who approach the Lord will eat the most holy offerings. There they will deposit the most holy offerings ​— ​the grain offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings ​— ​for the place is holy. <sup>14</sup> Once the priests have entered, they are not to go out from the holy area to the outer court until they have removed the clothes they minister in, for these are holy. They are to put on other clothes before they approach the public area.” <sup>15</sup> When he finished measuring inside the temple complex, he led me out by way of the gate that faced east and measured all </span>\n    <del>around</del>\n    <ins>round</ins>\n    <span> the complex. <sup>16</sup> He measured the east side with a measuring rod; it was </span>\n    <del>875 feet</del>\n    <ins>265 metres</ins>\n    <span> by the measuring rod. <sup>17</sup> He measured the north side; it was </span>\n    <del>875 feet</del>\n    <ins>265 metres</ins>\n    <span> by the measuring rod. <sup>18</sup> He measured the south side; it was </span>\n    <del>875 feet</del>\n    <ins>265 metres</ins>\n    <span> by the measuring rod. <sup>19</sup> Then he turned to the west side and measured </span>\n    <del>875 feet</del>\n    <ins>265 metres</ins>\n    <span> by the measuring rod. <sup>20</sup> He measured the temple complex on all four sides.

His voice sounded like the roar of a huge torrent, and the earth shone with his glory. <sup>3</sup> The vision I saw was like the one I had seen when he came to destroy the city, and like the ones I had seen by the Chebar Canal.

Write it down in their sight so that they may observe its complete design and all its statutes and may carry them out. <sup>12</sup> This is the law of the temple: All its surrounding territory on top of the mountain will be especially holy.

A young bull and a ram from the flock, both unblemished, are also to be offered. <sup>26</sup> For seven days the priests are to make atonement for the altar and cleanse it.

You broke my covenant by all your detestable practices. <sup>8</sup> You have not kept charge of my holy things but have appointed others to keep charge of my sanctuary for you.’ <sup>9</sup> “This is what the Lord God says: No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and flesh, may enter my sanctuary, not even a foreigner who is among the Israelites. <sup>10</sup> Surely the Levites who wandered away from me when Israel went astray, and who strayed from me after their idols, will bear the consequences of their iniquity. <sup>11</sup> Yet they will occupy my sanctuary, serving as guards at the temple gates and ministering at the temple. They will slaughter the burnt offerings and other sacrifices for the people and will stand before them to serve them. <sup>12</sup> Because they ministered to the house of Israel before their idols and became a sinful stumbling block to them, therefore I swore an oath against them” ​— ​this is the declaration of the Lord God ​— ​“that they would bear the consequences of their iniquity. <sup>13</sup> They must not approach me to serve me as priests or come near any of my holy things or the most holy things.

They are to observe my laws and statutes regarding all my appointed festivals, and keep my Sabbaths holy. <sup>25</sup> A priest may not come near a dead person so that he becomes defiled. However, he may defile himself for a father, a mother, a son, a daughter, a brother, or an unmarried sister. <sup>26</sup> After he is cleansed, he is to count </span>\n    <del>off </del>\n    <span>seven days for himself. <sup>27</sup> On the day he goes into the sanctuary, into the inner court to minister in the sanctuary, he is to present his sin offering.” This is the declaration of the Lord God. <sup>28</sup> “This will be their inheritance: I am their inheritance.

His inheritance belongs only to his sons; it is theirs. <sup>18</sup> The prince must not take any of the people’s inheritance, evicting them from their property. He is to provide an inheritance for his sons from his own property, so that none of my people will be displaced from his own property.” <sup>19</sup> Then he brought me through the entrance that was at the side of the gate, into the priests’ holy chambers, which faced north. I saw a place there at the far western end. <sup>20</sup> He said to me, “This is the place where the priests will boil the guilt offering and the sin offering, and where they will bake the grain offering, so that they do not bring them into the outer court and transmit holiness to the people.” <sup>21</sup> Next he brought me into the outer court and led me past its four corners. There was a separate court in each of its corners. <sup>22</sup> In the four corners of the outer court there were enclosed courts, </span>\n    <del>70 feet</del>\n    <ins>21.2 metres</ins>\n    <span> long by </span>\n    <del>52 1 /2 feet</del>\n    <ins>15.9 metres</ins>\n    <span> wide.

The water was coming down from under the south side of the threshold of the temple, south of the altar. <sup>2</sup> Next he brought me out by way of the north gate and led me </span>\n    <del>around</del>\n    <ins>round</ins>\n    <span> the outside to the outer gate that faced east; there the water was trickling from the south side. <sup>3</sup> As the man went out east with a measuring line in his hand, he measured off </span>\n    <del>a third of a mile</del>\n    <ins>five hundred</ins>\n    <span> and </span>\n    <ins>thirty metres and </ins>\n    <span>led me through the water.

It came up to my waist. <sup>5</sup> Again he measured off </span>\n    <del>a third of a mile</del>\n    <ins>five hundred and thirty metres</ins>\n    <span>, and it was a river that I could not cross on foot. For the water had risen; it was deep enough to swim in, a river that could not be crossed on foot. <sup>6</sup> He asked me, “Do you see this, son of man? ” Then he led me back to the bank of the river. <sup>7</sup> When I had returned, I saw a very large number of trees along both sides of the riverbank. <sup>8</sup> He said to me, “This water flows out to the eastern region and goes down to the Arabah. When it enters the sea, the sea of foul water, the water of the sea becomes fresh. <sup>9</sup> Every kind of living creature that swarms will live wherever the river flows, and there will be a huge number of fish because this water goes there. Since the water will become fresh, there will be life everywhere the river goes. <sup>10</sup> Fishermen will stand beside it from En-gedi to En-eglaim. These will become places where nets are spread out to dry. Their fish will consist of many different kinds, like the fish of the Mediterranean Sea. <sup>11</sup> Yet its swamps and marshes will not be healed; they will be left for salt. <sup>12</sup> All kinds of trees providing food will grow along both banks of the river. Their leaves will not wither, and their fruit will not fail. Each month they will bear fresh fruit because the water comes from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be used for eating and their leaves for healing.” <sup>13</sup> This is what the Lord God says: “This is the border you will use to divide the land as an inheritance for the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph will receive two shares. <sup>14</sup> You will inherit it in equal portions, since I swore to give it to your ancestors. So this land will fall to you as an inheritance. <sup>15</sup> This is to be the border of the land: On the north side it will extend from the Mediterranean Sea by way of Hethlon and Lebo-hamath to Zedad, <sup>16</sup> Berothah, and Sibraim (which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath), as far as Hazer-hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran. <sup>17</sup> So the border will run from the sea to Hazar-enon at the border of Damascus, with the territory of Hamath to the north. This will be the northern side. <sup>18</sup> On the east side it will run between Hauran and Damascus, along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel; you will measure from the northern border to the eastern sea. This will be the eastern side. <sup>19</sup> On the south side it will run from Tamar to the Waters of Meribath-kadesh, and on to the Brook of Egypt as far as the Mediterranean Sea. This will be the southern side. <sup>20</sup> On the west side the Mediterranean Sea will be the border, from the southern border up to a point opposite Lebo-hamath. This will be the western side. <sup>21</sup> “You are to divide this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel. <sup>22</sup> You will allot it as an inheritance for yourselves and for the </span>\n    <del>aliens</del>\n    <ins>foreigners</ins>\n    <span> residing among you, who have fathered children among you.
