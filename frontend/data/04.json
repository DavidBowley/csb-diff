["<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> These are the words Moses spoke to all Israel across the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Di-zahab. <sup>2</sup> It is an eleven-day journey from Horeb to Kadesh-barnea by way of Mount Seir. <sup>3</sup> In the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month, Moses told the Israelites everything the Lord had commanded him to say to them. <sup>4</sup> This was after he had defeated King Sihon of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and King Og of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth, at Edrei. <sup>5</sup> Across the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain this law, saying: <sup>6</sup> “The Lord our God spoke to us at Horeb: ‘You have stayed at this mountain long enough. <sup>7</sup> Resume your journey and go to the hill country of the Amorites and their </span>\n    <del>neighbors</del>\n    <ins>neighbours</ins>\n    <span> in the Arabah, the hill country, the Judean foothills, the Negev and the sea coast ​— ​to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon as far as the great river, the </span>\n    <del>Euphrates </del>\n    <span>River </span>\n    <ins>Euphrates</ins>\n    <span>. <sup>8</sup> See, I have set the land before you. Enter and take possession of the land the Lord swore to give to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their future descendants.’ <sup>9</sup> “I said to you at that time: I can’t bear the responsibility for you on my own. <sup>10</sup> The Lord your God has so multiplied you that today you are as numerous as the stars of the sky. <sup>11</sup> May the Lord, the God of your ancestors, increase you a thousand times more, and bless you as he promised you. <sup>12</sup> But how can I bear your troubles, burdens, and disputes by myself? <sup>13</sup> Appoint for yourselves wise, understanding, and respected men from each of your tribes, and I will make them your leaders. <sup>14</sup> “You replied to me, ‘What you propose to do is good.’ <sup>15</sup> “So I took the leaders of your tribes, wise and respected men, and set them over you as leaders: commanders for thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens, and officers for your tribes. <sup>16</sup> I commanded your judges at that time: Hear the cases between your brothers, and judge rightly between a man and his brother or his resident </span>\n    <del>alien</del>\n    <ins>foreigner</ins>\n    <span>. <sup>17</sup> Do not show partiality when deciding a case; listen to small and great alike. Do not be intimidated by anyone, for </span>\n    <del>judgment</del>\n    <ins>judgement</ins>\n    <span> belongs to God. Bring me any case too difficult for you, and I will hear it. <sup>18</sup> At that time I commanded you about all the things you were to do. <sup>19</sup> “We then set out from Horeb and went across all the great and terrible wilderness you saw on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, just as the Lord our God had commanded us. When we reached Kadesh-barnea, <sup>20</sup> I said to you: You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the Lord our God is giving us. <sup>21</sup> See, the Lord your God has set the land before you. Go up and take possession of it as the Lord, the God of your ancestors, has told you. Do not be afraid or discouraged. <sup>22</sup> “Then all of you approached me and said, ‘Let’s send men ahead of us, so that they may explore the land for us and bring us back a report about the route we should go up and the cities we will come to.’ <sup>23</sup> The plan seemed good to me, so I selected twelve men from among you, one man for each tribe. <sup>24</sup> They left and went up into the hill country and came to Eshcol Valley, scouting the land. <sup>25</sup> They took some of the fruit from the land in their hands, carried it down to us, and brought us back a report: ‘The land the Lord our God is giving us is good.’ <sup>26</sup> “But you were not willing to go up. You rebelled against the command of the Lord your God. <sup>27</sup> You grumbled in your tents and said, ‘The Lord brought us out of the land of Egypt to hand us over to the Amorites in order to destroy us, because he hates us. <sup>28</sup> Where can we go? Our brothers have made us lose heart, saying: The people are larger and taller than we are; the cities are large, fortified to the heavens. We also saw the descendants of the Anakim there.’ <sup>29</sup> “So I said to you: Don’t be terrified or afraid of them! <sup>30</sup> The Lord your God who goes before you will fight for you, just as you saw him do for you in Egypt. <sup>31</sup> And you saw in the wilderness how the Lord your God carried you as a man carries his son all along the way you </span>\n    <del>traveled</del>\n    <ins>travelled</ins>\n    <span> until you reached this place. <sup>32</sup> But in spite of this you did not trust the Lord your God, <sup>33</sup> who went before you on the journey to seek out a place for you to camp. He went in the fire by night and in the cloud by day to guide you on the road you were to travel. <sup>34</sup> “When the Lord heard your words, he grew angry and swore an oath: <sup>35</sup> ‘None of these men in this evil generation will see the good land I swore to give your ancestors, <sup>36</sup> except Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give him and his descendants the land on which he has set foot, because he remained loyal to the Lord.’ <sup>37</sup> “The Lord was angry with me also because of you and said, ‘You will not enter there either. <sup>38</sup> Joshua son of Nun, who attends you, will enter it. Encourage him, for he will enable Israel to inherit it. <sup>39</sup> Your children, who you said would be plunder, your sons who don’t yet know good from evil, will enter there. I will give them the land, and they will take possession of it. <sup>40</sup> But you are to turn back and head for the wilderness by way of the Red Sea.’ <sup>41</sup> “You answered me, ‘We have sinned against the Lord. We will go up and fight just as the Lord our God commanded us.’ Then each of you put on his weapons of war and thought it would be easy to go up into the hill country. <sup>42</sup> “But the Lord said to me, ‘Tell them: Don’t go up and fight, for I am not with you to keep you from being defeated by your enemies.’ <sup>43</sup> So I spoke to you, but you didn’t listen. You rebelled against the Lord’s command and defiantly went up into the hill country. <sup>44</sup> Then the Amorites who lived there came out against you and chased you like a swarm of bees. They routed you from Seir as far as Hormah. <sup>45</sup> When you returned, you wept before the Lord, but he didn’t listen to your requests or pay attention to you. <sup>46</sup> For this reason you stayed in Kadesh as long as you did. </span>\n  </p>\n","<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> “Then we turned back and headed for the wilderness by way of the Red Sea, as the Lord had told me, and we </span>\n    <del>traveled around</del>\n    <ins>travelled round</ins>\n    <span> the hill country of Seir for many days. <sup>2</sup> The Lord then said to me, <sup>3</sup> ‘You’ve been </span>\n    <del>traveling around</del>\n    <ins>travelling round</ins>\n    <span> this hill country long enough; turn north. <sup>4</sup> Command the people: You are about to travel through the territory of your brothers, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you, so be very careful. <sup>5</sup> Don’t provoke them, for I will not give you any of their land, not even a foot of it, because I have given Esau the hill country of Seir as his possession. <sup>6</sup> You may purchase food from them, so that you may eat, and buy water from them to drink. <sup>7</sup> For the Lord your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has watched over your journey through this immense wilderness. The Lord your God has been with you these past forty years, and you have lacked nothing.’ <sup>8</sup> “So we bypassed our brothers, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. We turned away from the Arabah road and from Elath and Ezion-geber. We </span>\n    <del>traveled</del>\n    <ins>travelled</ins>\n    <span> along the road to the Wilderness of Moab. <sup>9</sup> The Lord said to me, ‘Show no hostility </span>\n    <del>toward</del>\n    <ins>towards</ins>\n    <span> Moab, and do not provoke them to battle, for I will not give you any of their land as a possession, since I have given Ar as a possession to the descendants of Lot.’ ” <sup>10</sup> The Emim, a great and numerous people as tall as the Anakim, had previously lived there. <sup>11</sup> They were also regarded as Rephaim, like the Anakim, though the Moabites called them Emim. <sup>12</sup> The Horites had previously lived in Seir, but the descendants of Esau drove them out, destroying them completely and settling in their place, just as Israel did in the land of its possession the Lord gave them. <sup>13</sup> “The Lord said, ‘Now get up and cross the Zered Valley.’ So we crossed the Zered Valley. <sup>14</sup> The time we spent </span>\n    <del>traveling</del>\n    <ins>travelling</ins>\n    <span> from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed the Zered Valley was thirty-eight years until the entire generation of fighting men had perished from the camp, as the Lord had sworn to them. <sup>15</sup> Indeed, the Lord’s hand was against them, to eliminate them from the camp until they had all perished. <sup>16</sup> “When all the fighting men had died among the people, <sup>17</sup> the Lord spoke to me, <sup>18</sup> ‘Today you are going to cross the border of Moab at Ar. <sup>19</sup> When you get close to the Ammonites, don’t show any hostility to them or provoke them, for I will not give you any of the Ammonites’ land as a possession; I have given it as a possession to the descendants of Lot.’ ” <sup>20</sup> This too used to be regarded as the land of the Rephaim. The Rephaim lived there previously, though the Ammonites called them Zamzummim, <sup>21</sup> a great and numerous people, tall as the Anakim. The Lord destroyed the Rephaim at the advance of the Ammonites, so that they drove them out and settled in their place. <sup>22</sup> This was just as he had done for the descendants of Esau who lived in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites before them; they drove them out and have lived in their place until now. <sup>23</sup> The Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor, destroyed the Avvites, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, and settled in their place. <sup>24</sup> “The Lord also said, ‘Get up, move out, and cross the Arnon Valley. See, I have handed the Amorites’ King Sihon of Heshbon and his land over to you. Begin to take possession of it; engage him in battle. <sup>25</sup> Today I will begin to put the fear and dread of you on the peoples everywhere under heaven. They will hear the report about you, tremble, and be in anguish because of you.’ <sup>26</sup> “So I sent messengers with an offer of peace to King Sihon of Heshbon from the Wilderness of Kedemoth, saying, <sup>27</sup> ‘Let us travel through your land; we will keep strictly to the </span>\n    <del>highway</del>\n    <ins>main road</ins>\n    <span>. We will not turn to the right or the left. <sup>28</sup> You can sell us food in exchange for silver so we may eat, and give us water for silver so we may drink. Only let us travel through on foot, <sup>29</sup> just as the descendants of Esau who live in Seir did for us, and the Moabites who live in Ar, until we cross the Jordan into the land the Lord our God is giving us.’ <sup>30</sup> But King Sihon of Heshbon would not let us travel through his land, for the Lord your God had made his spirit stubborn and his heart obstinate in order to hand him over to you, as has now taken place. <sup>31</sup> “Then the Lord said to me, ‘See, I have begun to give Sihon and his land to you. Begin to take possession of it.’ <sup>32</sup> So Sihon and his whole army came out against us for battle at Jahaz. <sup>33</sup> The Lord our God handed him over to us, and we defeated him, his sons, and his whole army. <sup>34</sup> At that time we captured all his cities and completely destroyed the people of every city, including the women and children. We left no survivors. <sup>35</sup> We took only the livestock and the spoil from the cities we captured as plunder for ourselves. <sup>36</sup> There was no city that was inaccessible to us, from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley, along with the city in the valley, even as far as Gilead. The Lord our God gave everything to us. <sup>37</sup> But you did not go near the Ammonites’ land, all along the bank of the </span>\n    <del>Jabbok </del>\n    <span>River </span>\n    <ins>Jabbok</ins>\n    <span>, the cities of the hill country, or any place that the Lord our God had forbidden. </span>\n  </p>\n","<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> “Then we turned and went up the road to Bashan, and King Og of Bashan came out against us with his whole army to do battle at Edrei. <sup>2</sup> But the Lord said to me, ‘Do not fear him, for I have handed him over to you along with his whole army and his land. Do to him as you did to King Sihon of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.’ <sup>3</sup> So the Lord our God also handed over King Og of Bashan and his whole army to us. We struck him until there was no survivor left. <sup>4</sup> We captured all his cities at that time. There wasn’t a city that we didn’t take from them: sixty cities, the entire region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. <sup>5</sup> All these were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, besides a large number of rural villages. <sup>6</sup> We completely destroyed them, as we had done to King Sihon of Heshbon, destroying the men, women, and children of every city. <sup>7</sup> But we took all the livestock and the spoil from the cities as plunder for ourselves. <sup>8</sup> “At that time we took the land from the two Amorite kings across the Jordan, from the Arnon Valley as far as Mount Hermon, <sup>9</sup> which the Sidonians call Sirion, but the Amorites call Senir, <sup>10</sup> all the cities of the plateau, Gilead, and Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei, cities of Og’s kingdom in Bashan. <sup>11</sup> (Only King Og of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaim. His bed was made of iron. Isn’t it in Rabbah of the Ammonites? It is </span>\n    <del>13 1 /2 feet</del>\n    <ins>4 metres</ins>\n    <span> long and </span>\n    <del>6 feet</del>\n    <ins>1.8 metres</ins>\n    <span> wide by a standard measure. ) <sup>12</sup> “At that time we took possession of this land. I gave to the Reubenites and Gadites the area extending from Aroer by the Arnon Valley, and half the hill country of Gilead along with its cities. <sup>13</sup> I gave to half the tribe of Manasseh the rest of Gilead and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og. The entire region of Argob, the whole territory of Bashan, used to be called the land of the Rephaim. <sup>14</sup> Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took over the entire region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites. He called Bashan by his own name, Jair’s Villages, as it is today. <sup>15</sup> I gave Gilead to Machir, <sup>16</sup> and I gave to the Reubenites and Gadites the area extending from Gilead to the Arnon Valley (the middle of the valley was the border) and up to the </span>\n    <del>Jabbok </del>\n    <span>River </span>\n    <ins>Jabbok</ins>\n    <span>, the border of the Ammonites. <sup>17</sup> The Arabah and Jordan are also borders from Chinnereth as far as the Sea of the Arabah, the Dead Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah on the east. <sup>18</sup> “I commanded you at that time: The Lord your God has given you this land to possess. All your valiant men will cross over in battle formation ahead of your brothers the Israelites. <sup>19</sup> But your wives, dependents, and livestock ​— ​I know that you have a lot of livestock ​— ​will remain in the cities I have given you <sup>20</sup> until the Lord gives rest to your brothers as he has to you, and they also take possession of the land the Lord your God is giving them across the Jordan. Then each of you may return to his possession that I have given you. <sup>21</sup> “I commanded Joshua at that time: Your own eyes have seen everything the Lord your God has done to these two kings. The Lord will do the same to all the kingdoms you are about to enter. <sup>22</sup> Don’t be afraid of them, for the Lord your God fights for you. <sup>23</sup> “At that time I begged the Lord: <sup>24</sup> Lord God, you have begun to show your greatness and your strong hand to your servant, for what god is there in heaven or on earth who can perform deeds and mighty acts like yours? <sup>25</sup> Please let me cross over and see the beautiful land on the other side of the Jordan, that good hill country and Lebanon. <sup>26</sup> “But the Lord was angry with me because of you and would not listen to me. The Lord said to me, ‘That’s enough! Do not speak to me again about this matter. <sup>27</sup> Go to the top of Pisgah and look to the west, north, south, and east, and see it with your own eyes, for you will not cross the Jordan. <sup>28</sup> But commission Joshua and encourage and strengthen him, for he will cross over ahead of the people and enable them to inherit this land that you will see.’ <sup>29</sup> So we stayed in the valley facing Beth-peor. </span>\n  </p>\n","<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> “Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and ordinances I am teaching you to follow, so that you may live, enter, and take possession of the land the Lord, the God of your ancestors, is giving you. <sup>2</sup> You must not add anything to what I command you or take anything away from it, so that you may keep the commands of the Lord your God I am giving you. <sup>3</sup> Your eyes have seen what the Lord did at Baal-peor, for the Lord your God destroyed every one of you who followed Baal of Peor. <sup>4</sup> But you who have remained faithful to the Lord your God are all alive today. <sup>5</sup> Look, I have taught you statutes and ordinances as the Lord my God has commanded me, so that you may follow them in the land you are entering to possess. <sup>6</sup> Carefully follow them, for this will show your wisdom and understanding in the eyes of the peoples. When they hear about all these statutes, they will say, ‘This great nation is indeed a wise and understanding people.’ <sup>7</sup> For what great nation is there that has a god near to it as the Lord our God is to us whenever we call to him? <sup>8</sup> And what great nation has righteous statutes and ordinances like this entire law I set before you today? <sup>9</sup> “Only be on your guard and diligently watch yourselves, so that you don’t forget the things your eyes have seen and so that they don’t slip from your mind as long as you live. Teach them to your children and your grandchildren. <sup>10</sup> The day you stood before the Lord your God at Horeb, the Lord said to me, ‘Assemble the people before me, and I will let them hear my words, so that they may learn to fear me all the days they live on the earth and may instruct their children.’ <sup>11</sup> You came near and stood at the base of the mountain, a mountain blazing with fire into the heavens and enveloped in a totally black cloud. <sup>12</sup> Then the Lord spoke to you from the fire. You kept hearing the sound of the words, but didn’t see a form; there was only a voice. <sup>13</sup> He declared his covenant to you. He commanded you to follow the Ten Commandments, which he wrote on two stone tablets. <sup>14</sup> At that time the Lord commanded me to teach you statutes and ordinances for you to follow in the land you are about to cross into and possess. <sup>15</sup> “Diligently watch yourselves ​— ​because you did not see any form on the day the Lord spoke to you out of the fire at Horeb ​— ​ <sup>16</sup> so you don’t act corruptly and make an idol for yourselves in the shape of any figure: a male or female form, <sup>17</sup> or the form of any animal on the earth, any winged creature that flies in the sky, <sup>18</sup> any creature that crawls on the ground, or any fish in the waters under the earth. <sup>19</sup> When you look to the heavens and see the sun, moon, and stars ​— ​all the stars in the sky ​— ​do not be led astray to bow in worship to them and serve them. The Lord your God has provided them for all people everywhere under heaven. <sup>20</sup> But the Lord selected you and brought you out of Egypt’s iron furnace to be a people for his inheritance, as you are today. <sup>21</sup> “The Lord was angry with me on your account. He swore that I would not cross the Jordan and enter the good land the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance. <sup>22</sup> I won’t be crossing the Jordan because I am going to die in this land. But you are about to cross over and take possession of this good land. <sup>23</sup> Be careful not to forget the covenant of the Lord your God that he made with you, and make an idol for yourselves in the shape of anything he has forbidden you. <sup>24</sup> For the Lord your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God. <sup>25</sup> “When you have children and grandchildren and have been in the land a long time, and if you act corruptly, make an idol in the form of anything, and do what is evil in the sight of the Lord your God, angering him, <sup>26</sup> I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today that you will quickly perish from the land you are about to cross the Jordan to possess. You will not live long there, but you will certainly be destroyed. <sup>27</sup> The Lord will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be reduced to a few survivors among the nations where the Lord your God will drive you. <sup>28</sup> There you will worship man-made gods of wood and stone, which cannot see, hear, eat, or smell. <sup>29</sup> But from there, you will search for the Lord your God, and you will find him when you seek him with all your heart and all your soul. <sup>30</sup> When you are in distress and all these things have happened to you, in the future you will return to the Lord your God and obey him. <sup>31</sup> He will not leave you, destroy you, or forget the covenant with your ancestors that he swore to them by oath, because the Lord your God is a compassionate God. <sup>32</sup> “Indeed, ask about the earlier days that preceded you, from the day God created mankind on the earth and from one end of the heavens to the other: Has anything like this great event ever happened, or has anything like it been heard of? <sup>33</sup> Has a people heard God’s voice speaking from the fire as you have, and lived? <sup>34</sup> Or has a god attempted to go and take a nation as his own out of another nation, by trials, signs, wonders, and war, by a strong hand and an outstretched arm, by great terrors, as the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes? <sup>35</sup> You were shown these things so that you would know that the Lord is God; there is no other besides him. <sup>36</sup> He let you hear his voice from heaven to instruct you. He showed you his great fire on earth, and you heard his words from the fire. <sup>37</sup> Because he loved your ancestors, he chose their descendants after them and brought you out of Egypt by his presence and great power, <sup>38</sup> to drive out before you nations greater and stronger than you and to bring you in and give you their land as an inheritance, as is now taking place. <sup>39</sup> Today, </span>\n    <del>recognize</del>\n    <ins>recognise</ins>\n    <span> and keep in mind that the Lord is God in heaven above and on earth below; there is no other. <sup>40</sup> Keep his statutes and commands, which I am giving you today, so that you and your children after you may prosper and so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you for all time.” <sup>41</sup> Then Moses set apart three cities across the Jordan to the east. <sup>42</sup> Someone could flee there who committed manslaughter, killing his </span>\n    <del>neighbor</del>\n    <ins>neighbour</ins>\n    <span> accidentally without previously hating him. He could flee to one of these cities and stay alive: <sup>43</sup> Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau land, belonging to the Reubenites; Ramoth in Gilead, belonging to the Gadites; or Golan in Bashan, belonging to the Manassites. <sup>44</sup> This is the law Moses gave the Israelites. <sup>45</sup> These are the decrees, statutes, and ordinances Moses proclaimed to them after they came out of Egypt, <sup>46</sup> across the Jordan in the valley facing Beth-peor in the land of King Sihon of the Amorites. He lived in Heshbon, and Moses and the Israelites defeated him after they came out of Egypt. <sup>47</sup> They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two Amorite kings who were across the Jordan to the east, <sup>48</sup> from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley as far as Mount Sion (that is, Hermon) <sup>49</sup> and all the Arabah on the east side of the Jordan as far as the Dead Sea below the slopes of Pisgah. </span>\n  </p>\n","<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> Moses summoned all Israel and said to them, “Israel, listen to the statutes and ordinances I am proclaiming as you hear them today. Learn and follow them carefully. <sup>2</sup> The Lord our God made a covenant with us at Horeb. <sup>3</sup> He did not make this covenant with our ancestors, but with all of us who are alive here today. <sup>4</sup> The Lord spoke to you face to face from the fire on the mountain. <sup>5</sup> At that time I was standing between the Lord and you to report the word of the Lord to you, because you were afraid of the fire and did not go up the mountain. And he said: <sup>6</sup> I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the place of slavery. <sup>7</sup> Do not have other gods besides me. <sup>8</sup> Do not make an idol for yourself in the shape of anything in the heavens above or on the earth below or in the waters under the earth. <sup>9</sup> Do not bow in worship to them, and do not serve them, because I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, bringing the consequences of the fathers’ iniquity on the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate me, <sup>10</sup> but showing faithful love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commands. <sup>11</sup> Do not misuse the name of the Lord your God, because the Lord will not leave anyone unpunished who misuses his name. <sup>12</sup> Be careful to remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy as the Lord your God has commanded you. <sup>13</sup> You are to </span>\n    <del>labor</del>\n    <ins>labour</ins>\n    <span> six days and do all your work, <sup>14</sup> but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. Do not do any work ​— ​you, your son or daughter, your male or female slave, your ox or donkey, any of your livestock, or the resident </span>\n    <del>alien</del>\n    <ins>foreigner</ins>\n    <span> who lives within your city gates, so that your male and female slaves may rest as you do. <sup>15</sup> Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God brought you out of there with a strong hand and an outstretched arm. That is why the Lord your God has commanded you to keep the Sabbath day. <sup>16</sup> </span>\n    <del>Honor</del>\n    <ins>Honour</ins>\n    <span> your father and your mother, as the Lord your God has commanded you, so that you may live long and so that you may prosper in the land the Lord your God is giving you. <sup>17</sup> Do not murder. <sup>18</sup> Do not commit adultery. <sup>19</sup> Do not steal. <sup>20</sup> Do not give dishonest testimony against your </span>\n    <del>neighbor</del>\n    <ins>neighbour</ins>\n    <span>. <sup>21</sup> Do not covet your </span>\n    <del>neighbor</del>\n    <ins>neighbour</ins>\n    <span>’s wife or desire your </span>\n    <del>neighbor</del>\n    <ins>neighbour</ins>\n    <span>’s house, his field, his male or female slave, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your </span>\n    <del>neighbor</del>\n    <ins>neighbour</ins>\n    <span>. <sup>22</sup> “The Lord spoke these commands in a loud voice to your entire assembly from the fire, cloud, and total darkness on the mountain; he added nothing more. He wrote them on two stone tablets and gave them to me. <sup>23</sup> All of you approached me with your tribal leaders and elders when you heard the voice from the darkness and while the mountain was blazing with fire. <sup>24</sup> You said, ‘Look, the Lord our God has shown us his glory and greatness, and we have heard his voice from the fire. Today we have seen that God speaks with a person, yet he still lives. <sup>25</sup> But now, why should we die? This great fire will consume us and we will die if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any longer. <sup>26</sup> For who out of all humanity has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the fire, as we have, and lived? <sup>27</sup> Go near and listen to everything the Lord our God says.

He will place an iron yoke on your neck until he has destroyed you. <sup>49</sup> The Lord will bring a nation from far away, from the ends of the earth, to swoop down on you like an eagle, a nation whose language you won’t understand, <sup>50</sup> a ruthless nation, showing no respect for the old and not sparing the young. <sup>51</sup> They will eat the offspring of your livestock and your land’s produce until you are destroyed. They will leave you no grain, new wine, fresh oil, young of your herds, or newborn of your flocks until they cause you to perish. <sup>52</sup> They will besiege you within all your city gates until your high and fortified walls, that you trust in, come down throughout your land. They will besiege you within all your city gates throughout the land the Lord your God has given you. <sup>53</sup> “You will eat your offspring, the flesh of your sons and daughters the Lord your God has given you during the siege and hardship your enemy imposes on you. <sup>54</sup> The most sensitive and refined man among you will look grudgingly at his brother, the wife he embraces, and the rest of his children, <sup>55</sup> refusing to share with any of them his children’s flesh that he will eat because he has nothing left during the siege and hardship your enemy imposes on you in all your towns. <sup>56</sup> The most sensitive and refined woman among you, who would not venture to set the sole of her foot on the ground because of her refinement and sensitivity, will begrudge the husband she embraces, her son, and her daughter, <sup>57</sup> the afterbirth that comes out from between her legs and the children she bears, because she will secretly eat them for lack of anything else during the siege and hardship your enemy imposes on you within your city gates. <sup>58</sup> “If you are not careful to obey all the words of this law, which are written in this scroll, by fearing this glorious and awe-inspiring name ​— ​the Lord, your God ​— ​ <sup>59</sup> he will bring wondrous plagues on you and your descendants, severe and lasting plagues, and terrible and chronic </span>\n    <del>sicknesses</del>\n    <ins>diseases</ins>\n    <span>. <sup>60</sup> He will afflict you again with all the diseases of Egypt, which you dreaded, and they will cling to you. <sup>61</sup> The Lord will also afflict you with every </span>\n    <del>sickness</del>\n    <ins>disease</ins>\n    <span> and plague not recorded in the book of this law, until you are destroyed. <sup>62</sup> Though you were as numerous as the stars of the sky, you will be left with only a few people, because you did not obey the Lord your God. <sup>63</sup> Just as the Lord was glad to cause you to prosper and to multiply you, so he will also be glad to cause you to perish and to destroy you. You will be ripped out of the land you are entering to possess. <sup>64</sup> Then the Lord will scatter you among all peoples from one end of the earth to the other, and there you will worship other gods, of wood and stone, which neither you nor your ancestors have known. <sup>65</sup> You will find no peace among those nations, and there will be no resting place for the sole of your foot. There the Lord will give you a trembling heart, failing eyes, and a despondent spirit. <sup>66</sup> Your life will hang in doubt before you. You will be in dread night and day, never certain of survival. <sup>67</sup> In the morning you will say, ‘If only it were evening! ’ and in the evening you will say, ‘If only it were morning! ’ ​— ​because of the dread you will have in your heart and because of what you will see. <sup>68</sup> The Lord will take you back in ships to Egypt by a route that I said you would never see again. There you will sell yourselves to your enemies as male and female slaves, but no one will buy you.” </span>\n  </p>\n","<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> These are the words of the covenant that the Lord commanded Moses to make with the Israelites in the land of Moab, in addition to the covenant he had made with them at Horeb. <sup>2</sup> Moses summoned all Israel and said to them, “You have seen with your own eyes everything the Lord did in Egypt to Pharaoh, to all his officials, and to his entire land. <sup>3</sup> You saw with your own eyes the great trials and those great signs and wonders. <sup>4</sup> Yet to this day the Lord has not given you a mind to understand, eyes to see, or ears to hear. <sup>5</sup> I led you </span>\n    <ins>for </ins>\n    <span>forty years in the wilderness; your clothes and the sandals on your feet did not wear out; <sup>6</sup> you did not eat food or drink wine or beer ​— ​so that you might know that I am the Lord your God. <sup>7</sup> When you reached this place, King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan came out against us in battle, but we defeated them. <sup>8</sup> We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh. <sup>9</sup> Therefore, observe the words of this covenant and follow them, so that you will succeed in everything you do. <sup>10</sup> “All of you are standing today before the Lord your God ​— ​your leaders, tribes, elders, officials, all the men of Israel, <sup>11</sup> your dependents, your wives, and the resident </span>\n    <del>aliens</del>\n    <ins>foreigners</ins>\n    <span> in your camps who cut your wood and draw your water ​— ​ <sup>12</sup> so that you may enter into the covenant of the Lord your God, which he is making with you today, so that you may enter into his oath <sup>13</sup> and so that he may establish you today as his people and he may be your God as he promised you and as he swore to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. <sup>14</sup> I am making this covenant and this oath not only with you, <sup>15</sup> but also with those who are standing here with us today in the presence of the Lord our God and with those who are not here today. <sup>16</sup> “Indeed, you know how we lived in the land of Egypt and passed through the nations where you </span>\n    <del>traveled</del>\n    <ins>travelled</ins>\n    <span>. <sup>17</sup> You saw their abhorrent images and idols made of wood, stone, silver, and gold, which were among them. <sup>18</sup> Be sure there is no man, woman, clan, or tribe among you today whose heart turns away from the Lord our God to go and worship the gods of those nations. Be sure there is no root among you bearing poisonous and bitter fruit. <sup>19</sup> When someone hears the words of this oath, he may consider himself exempt, thinking, ‘I will have peace even though I follow my own stubborn heart.’ This will lead to the destruction of the well-watered land as well as the dry land. <sup>20</sup> The Lord will not be willing to forgive him. Instead, his anger and jealousy will burn against that person, and every curse written in this scroll will descend on him. The Lord will blot out his name under heaven, <sup>21</sup> and single him out for harm from all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant written in this book of the law. <sup>22</sup> “Future generations of your children who follow you and the foreigner who comes from a distant country will see the plagues of that land and the </span>\n    <del>sicknesses</del>\n    <ins>diseases</ins>\n    <span> the Lord has inflicted on it. <sup>23</sup> All its soil will be a burning waste of </span>\n    <del>sulfur</del>\n    <ins>sulphur</ins>\n    <span> and salt, unsown, producing nothing, with no plant growing on it, just like the fall of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the Lord demolished in his fierce anger. <sup>24</sup> All the nations will ask, ‘Why has the Lord done this to this land? Why this intense outburst of anger? ’ <sup>25</sup> Then people will answer, ‘It is because they abandoned the covenant of the Lord, the God of their ancestors, which he had made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt. <sup>26</sup> They began to serve other gods, bowing in worship to gods they had not known ​— ​gods that the Lord had not permitted them to worship. <sup>27</sup> Therefore the Lord’s anger burned against this land, and he brought every curse written in this book on it. <sup>28</sup> The Lord uprooted them from their land in his anger, rage, and intense wrath, and threw them into another land where they are today.’ <sup>29</sup> The hidden things belong to the Lord our God, but the revealed things belong to us and our children </span>\n    <del>forever</del>\n    <ins>for ever</ins>\n    <span>, so that we may follow all the words of this law. </span>\n  </p>\n","<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> “When all these things happen to you ​— ​the blessings and curses I have set before you ​— ​and you come to your senses while you are in all the nations where the Lord your God has driven you, <sup>2</sup> and you and your children return to the Lord your God and obey him with all your heart and all your soul by doing everything I am commanding you today, <sup>3</sup> then he will restore your fortunes, have compassion on you, and gather you again from all the peoples where the Lord your God has scattered you. <sup>4</sup> Even if your exiles are at the farthest horizon, he will gather you and bring you back from there. <sup>5</sup> The Lord your God will bring you into the land your ancestors possessed, and you will take possession of it. He will cause you to prosper and multiply you more than he did your ancestors. <sup>6</sup> The Lord your God will circumcise your heart and the hearts of your descendants, and you will love him with all your heart and all your soul so that you will live. <sup>7</sup> The Lord your God will put all these curses on your enemies who hate and persecute you. <sup>8</sup> Then you will again obey him and follow all his commands I am commanding you today. <sup>9</sup> The Lord your God will make you prosper abundantly in all the work of your hands, your offspring, the offspring of your livestock, and the produce of your land. Indeed, the Lord will again delight in your prosperity, as he delighted in that of your ancestors, <sup>10</sup> when you obey the Lord your God by keeping his commands and statutes that are written in this book of the law and return to him with all your heart and all your soul. <sup>11</sup> “This command that I give you today is certainly not too difficult or beyond your reach. <sup>12</sup> It is not in heaven so that you have to ask, ‘Who will go up to heaven, get it for us, and proclaim it to us so that we may follow it? ’ <sup>13</sup> And it is not across the sea so that you have to ask, ‘Who will cross the sea, get it for us, and proclaim it to us so that we may follow it? ’ <sup>14</sup> But the message is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, so that you may follow it. <sup>15</sup> See, today I have set before you life and prosperity, death and adversity. <sup>16</sup> For I am commanding you today to love the Lord your God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commands, statutes, and ordinances, so that you may live and multiply, and the Lord your God may bless you in the land you are entering to possess. <sup>17</sup> But if your heart turns away and you do not listen and you are led astray to bow in worship to other gods and serve them, <sup>18</sup> I tell you today that you will certainly perish and will not prolong your days in the land you are entering to possess across the Jordan. <sup>19</sup> I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse. Choose life so that you and your descendants may live, <sup>20</sup> love the Lord your God, obey him, and remain faithful to him. For he is your life, and he will prolong your days as you live in the land the Lord swore to give to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” </span>\n  </p>\n","<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> Then Moses continued to speak these words to all Israel, <sup>2</sup> saying, “I am now 120 years old; I can no longer act as your leader. The Lord has told me, ‘You will not cross the Jordan.’ <sup>3</sup> The Lord your God is the one who will cross ahead of you. He will destroy these nations before you, and you will drive them out. Joshua is the one who will cross ahead of you, as the Lord has said. <sup>4</sup> The Lord will deal with them as he did Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, and their land when he destroyed them. <sup>5</sup> The Lord will deliver them over to you, and you must do to them exactly as I have commanded you. <sup>6</sup> Be strong and courageous; don’t be terrified or afraid of them. For the Lord your God is the one who will go with you; he will not leave you or abandon you.” <sup>7</sup> Moses then summoned Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel, “Be strong and courageous, for you will go with this people into the land the Lord swore to give to their ancestors. You will enable them to take possession of it. <sup>8</sup> The Lord is the one who will go before you. He will be with you; he will not leave you or abandon you. Do not be afraid or discouraged.” <sup>9</sup> Moses wrote down this law and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who carried the ark of the Lord’s covenant, and to all the elders of Israel. <sup>10</sup> Moses commanded them, “At the end of every seven years, at the appointed time in the year of debt cancellation, during the Festival of Shelters, <sup>11</sup> when all Israel assembles in the presence of the Lord your God at the place he chooses, you are to read this law aloud before all Israel. <sup>12</sup> Gather the people ​— ​men, women, dependents, and the resident </span>\n    <del>aliens</del>\n    <ins>foreigners</ins>\n    <span> within your city gates ​— ​so that they may listen and learn to fear the Lord your God and be careful to follow all the words of this law. <sup>13</sup> Then their children who do not know the law will listen and learn to fear the Lord your God as long as you live in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess.” <sup>14</sup> The Lord said to Moses, “The time of your death is now approaching. Call Joshua and present yourselves at the tent of meeting so that I may commission him.” When Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves at the tent of meeting, <sup>15</sup> the Lord appeared at the tent in a pillar of cloud, and the cloud stood at the entrance to the tent. <sup>16</sup> The Lord said to Moses, “You are about to rest with your ancestors, and these people will soon prostitute themselves with the foreign gods of the land they are entering. They will abandon me and break the covenant I have made with them. <sup>17</sup> My anger will burn against them on that day; I will abandon them and hide my face from them so that they will become easy prey. Many troubles and afflictions will come to them. On that day they will say, ‘Haven’t these troubles come to us because our God is no longer with us? ’ <sup>18</sup> I will certainly hide my face on that day because of all the evil they have done by turning to other gods. <sup>19</sup> Therefore write down this song for yourselves and teach it to the Israelites; have them sing it, so that this song may be a witness for me against the Israelites. <sup>20</sup> When I bring them into the land I swore to give their ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey, they will eat their fill and prosper. They will turn to other gods and worship them, despising me and breaking my covenant. <sup>21</sup> And when many troubles and afflictions come to them, this song will testify against them, because their descendants will not have forgotten it. For I know what they are prone to do, even before I bring them into the land I swore to give them.” <sup>22</sup> So Moses wrote down this song on that day and taught it to the Israelites. <sup>23</sup> The Lord commissioned Joshua son of Nun, “Be strong and courageous, for you will bring the Israelites into the land I swore to them, and I will be with you.” <sup>24</sup> When Moses had finished writing down on a scroll every single word of this law, <sup>25</sup> he commanded the Levites who carried the ark of the Lord’s covenant, <sup>26</sup> “Take this book of the law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God so that it may remain there as a witness against you. <sup>27</sup> For I know how rebellious and stiff-necked you are. If you are rebelling against the Lord now, while I am still alive, how much more will you rebel after I am dead! <sup>28</sup> Assemble all your tribal elders and officers before me so that I may speak these words directly to them and call heaven and earth as witnesses against them. <sup>29</sup> For I know that after my death you will become completely corrupt and turn from the path I have commanded you. Disaster will come to you in the future, because you will do what is evil in the Lord’s sight, angering him with what your hands have made.” <sup>30</sup> Then Moses recited aloud every single word of this song to the entire assembly of Israel: </span>\n  </p>\n","<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> Pay attention, heavens, and I will speak; listen, earth, to the words from my mouth. <sup>2</sup> Let my teaching fall like rain and my word settle like dew, like gentle rain on new grass and showers on tender plants. <sup>3</sup> For I will proclaim the Lord’s name. Declare the greatness of our God! <sup>4</sup> The Rock ​— ​his work is perfect; all his ways are just. A faithful God, without bias, he is righteous and true. <sup>5</sup> His people have acted corruptly </span>\n    <del>toward</del>\n    <ins>towards</ins>\n    <span> him; this is their defect ​— ​they are not his children but a devious and crooked generation. <sup>6</sup> Is this how you repay the Lord, you foolish and senseless people? Isn’t he your Father and Creator? Didn’t he make you and sustain you? <sup>7</sup> Remember the days of old; consider the years of past generations. Ask your father, and he will tell you, your elders, and they will teach you. <sup>8</sup> When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance and divided the human race, he set the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the people of Israel. <sup>9</sup> But the Lord’s portion is his people, Jacob, his own inheritance. <sup>10</sup> He found him in a desolate land, in a barren, howling wilderness; he surrounded him, cared for him, and protected him as the pupil of his eye. <sup>11</sup> He watches over his nest like an eagle and hovers over his young; he spreads his wings, catches him, and carries him on his feathers. <sup>12</sup> The Lord alone led him, with no help from a foreign god. <sup>13</sup> He made him ride on the heights of the land and eat the produce of the field. He nourished him with honey from the rock and oil from flinty rock, <sup>14</sup> curds from the herd and milk from the flock, with the fat of lambs, rams from Bashan, and goats, with the choicest grains of wheat; you drank wine from the finest grapes. <sup>15</sup> Then Jeshurun became fat and rebelled — you became fat, bloated, and gorged. He abandoned the God who made him and scorned the Rock of his salvation. <sup>16</sup> They provoked his jealousy with different gods; they enraged him with detestable practices. <sup>17</sup> They sacrificed to demons, not God, to gods they had not known, new gods that had just arrived, which your ancestors did not fear. <sup>18</sup> You ignored the Rock who gave you birth; you forgot the God who gave birth to you. <sup>19</sup> When the Lord saw this, he despised them, angered by his sons and daughters. <sup>20</sup> He said, “I will hide my face from them; I will see what will become of them, for they are a perverse generation — unfaithful children. <sup>21</sup> They have provoked my jealousy with what is not a god; they have enraged me with their worthless idols. So I will provoke their jealousy with what is not a people; I will enrage them with a foolish nation. <sup>22</sup> For fire has been kindled because of my anger and burns to the depths of Sheol; it devours the land and its produce, and scorches the foundations of the mountains. <sup>23</sup> “I will pile disasters on them; I will use up my arrows against them. <sup>24</sup> They will be weak from hunger, ravaged by pestilence and bitter plague; I will unleash on them wild beasts with fangs, as well as venomous snakes that slither in the dust. <sup>25</sup> Outside, the sword will take their children, and inside, there will be terror; the young man and the young woman will be killed, the infant and the </span>\n    <del>gray</del>\n    <ins>grey</ins>\n    <span>-haired man. <sup>26</sup> “I would have said: I will cut them to pieces and blot out the memory of them from mankind, <sup>27</sup> if I had not feared provocation from the enemy, or feared that these foes might misunderstand and say, ‘Our own hand has prevailed; it wasn’t the Lord who did all this.’ ” <sup>28</sup> Israel is a nation lacking sense with no understanding at all. <sup>29</sup> If only they were wise, they would comprehend this; they would understand their fate. <sup>30</sup> How could one pursue a thousand, or two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, unless the Lord had given them up? <sup>31</sup> But their “rock” is not like our Rock, as even our enemies concede. <sup>32</sup> For their vine is from the vine of Sodom and from the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes are poisonous; their clusters are bitter. <sup>33</sup> Their wine is serpents’ venom, the deadly poison of cobras. <sup>34</sup> “Is it not stored up with me, sealed up in my vaults? <sup>35</sup> Vengeance and retribution belong to me. In time their foot will slip, for their day of disaster is near, and their doom is coming quickly.” <sup>36</sup> The Lord will indeed vindicate his people and have compassion on his servants when he sees that their strength is gone and no one is left ​— ​slave or free. <sup>37</sup> He will say, “Where are their gods, the </span>\n    <del>‘</del>\n    <ins>“</ins>\n    <span>rock</span>\n    <del>’</del>\n    <ins>”</ins>\n    <span> they found refuge in? <sup>38</sup> Who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings? Let them rise up and help you; let it be a shelter for you. <sup>39</sup> See now that I alone am he; there is no God but me. I bring death and I give life; I wound and I heal. No one can rescue anyone from my power. <sup>40</sup> I raise my hand to heaven and declare: As surely as I live </span>\n    <del>forever</del>\n    <ins>for ever</ins>\n    <span>, <sup>41</sup> when I sharpen my flashing sword, and my hand takes hold of </span>\n    <del>judgment</del>\n    <ins>judgement</ins>\n    <span>, I will take vengeance on my adversaries and repay those who hate me. <sup>42</sup> I will make my arrows drunk with blood while my sword devours flesh — the blood of the slain and the captives, the heads of the enemy leaders.” <sup>43</sup> Rejoice, you nations, concerning his people, for he will avenge the blood of his servants. He will take vengeance on his adversaries; he will purify his land and his people. <sup>44</sup> Moses came with Joshua son of Nun and recited all the words of this song in the presence of the people. <sup>45</sup> After Moses finished reciting all these words to all Israel, <sup>46</sup> he said to them, “Take to heart all these words I am giving as a warning to you today, so that you may command your children to follow all the words of this law carefully. <sup>47</sup> For they are not meaningless words to you but they are your life, and by them you will live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess.” <sup>48</sup> On that same day the Lord spoke to Moses, <sup>49</sup> “Go up Mount Nebo in the Abarim range in the land of Moab, </span>\n    <del>across from</del>\n    <ins>opposite</ins>\n    <span> Jericho, and view the land of Canaan I am giving the Israelites as a possession. <sup>50</sup> Then you will die on the mountain that you go up, and you will be gathered to your people, just as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people. <sup>51</sup> For both of you broke faith with me among the Israelites at the Waters of Meribath-kadesh in the Wilderness of Zin by failing to treat me as holy in their presence. <sup>52</sup> Although from a distance you will view the land that I am giving the Israelites, you will not go there.” </span>\n  </p>\n","<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> This is the blessing that Moses, the man of God, gave the Israelites before his death. <sup>2</sup> He said: The Lord came from Sinai and appeared to them from Seir; he shone on them from Mount Paran and came with ten thousand holy ones, with lightning from his right hand for them. <sup>3</sup> Indeed he loves the people. All your holy ones are in your hand, and they assemble at your feet. Each receives your words. <sup>4</sup> Moses gave us instruction, a possession for the assembly of Jacob. <sup>5</sup> So he became King in Jeshurun when the leaders of the people gathered with the tribes of Israel. <sup>6</sup> Let Reuben live and not die though his people become few. <sup>7</sup> He said this about Judah: Lord, hear Judah’s cry and bring him to his people. He fights for his cause with his own hands, but may you be a help against his foes. <sup>8</sup> He said about Levi: Your Thummim and Urim belong to your faithful one; you tested him at Massah and contended with him at the Waters of Meribah. <sup>9</sup> He said about his father and mother, “I do not regard them.” He disregarded his brothers and didn’t acknowledge his sons, for they kept your word and maintained your covenant. <sup>10</sup> They will teach your ordinances to Jacob and your instruction to Israel; they will set incense before you and whole burnt offerings on your altar. <sup>11</sup> Lord, bless his possessions, and accept the work of his hands. Break the back of his adversaries and enemies, so that they cannot rise again. <sup>12</sup> He said about Benjamin: The Lord’s beloved rests securely on him. He shields him all day long, and he rests on his shoulders. <sup>13</sup> He said about Joseph: May his land be blessed by the Lord with the dew of heaven’s bounty and the watery depths that lie beneath; <sup>14</sup> with the bountiful harvest from the sun and the abundant yield of the seasons; <sup>15</sup> with the best products of the ancient mountains and the bounty of the eternal hills; <sup>16</sup> with the choice gifts of the land and everything in it; and with the </span>\n    <del>favor</del>\n    <ins>favour</ins>\n    <span> of him who appeared in the burning bush. May these rest on the head of Joseph, on the brow of the prince of his brothers. <sup>17</sup> His firstborn bull has </span>\n    <del>splendor</del>\n    <ins>splendour</ins>\n    <span>, and horns like those of a wild ox; he gores all the peoples with them to the ends of the earth. Such are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and such are the thousands of Manasseh. <sup>18</sup> He said about Zebulun: Rejoice, Zebulun, in your journeys, and Issachar, in your tents. <sup>19</sup> They summon the peoples to a mountain; there they offer acceptable sacrifices. For they draw from the wealth of the seas and the hidden treasures of the sand. <sup>20</sup> He said about Gad: The one who enlarges Gad’s territory will be blessed. He lies down like a lion and tears off an arm or even a head. <sup>21</sup> He chose the best part for himself, because a ruler’s portion was assigned there for him. He came with the leaders of the people; he carried out the Lord’s justice and his ordinances for Israel. <sup>22</sup> He said about Dan: Dan is a young lion, leaping out of Bashan. <sup>23</sup> He said about Naphtali: Naphtali, enjoying approval, full of the Lord’s blessing, take possession to the west and the south. <sup>24</sup> He said about Asher: May Asher be the most blessed of the sons; may he be the most </span>\n    <del>favored</del>\n    <ins>favoured</ins>\n    <span> among his brothers and dip his foot in olive oil. <sup>25</sup> May the bolts of your gate be iron and bronze, and your strength last as long as you live. <sup>26</sup> There is none like the God of Jeshurun, who rides the heavens to your aid, the clouds in his majesty. <sup>27</sup> The God of old is your dwelling place, and underneath are the everlasting arms. He drives out the enemy before you and commands, “Destroy! ” <sup>28</sup> So Israel dwells securely; Jacob lives untroubled in a land of grain and new wine; even his skies drip with dew. <sup>29</sup> How happy you are, Israel! Who is like you, a people saved by the Lord? He is the shield that protects you, the sword you boast in. Your enemies will cringe before you, and you will tread on their backs. </span>\n  </p>\n","<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which faces Jericho, and the Lord showed him all the land: Gilead as far as Dan, <sup>2</sup> all of Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the Mediterranean Sea, <sup>3</sup> the Negev, and the plain in the Valley of Jericho, the City of Palms, as far as Zoar. <sup>4</sup> The Lord then said to him, “This is the land I promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’ I have let you see it with your own eyes, but you will not cross into it.” <sup>5</sup> So Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab, according to the Lord’s word. <sup>6</sup> He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab facing Beth-peor, and no one to this day knows where his grave is. <sup>7</sup> Moses was </span>\n    <del>one hundred twenty</del>\n    <ins>120</ins>\n    <span> years old when he died; his eyes were not weak, and his vitality had not left him. <sup>8</sup> The Israelites wept for Moses in the plains of Moab </span>\n    <ins>for </ins>\n    <span>thirty days. Then the days of weeping and mourning for Moses came to an end. <sup>9</sup> Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands on him. So the Israelites obeyed him and did as the Lord had commanded Moses. <sup>10</sup> No prophet has arisen again in Israel like Moses, whom the </span>\n    <del>L</del>\n    <ins>Lord</ins>\n    <span> knew face to face. <sup>11</sup> He was unparalleled for all the signs and wonders the Lord sent him to do against the land of Egypt ​— ​to Pharaoh, to all his officials, and to all his land </span>\n    <ins>​</ins>\n    <span>— </span>\n    <ins>​ </ins>\n    <span><sup>12</sup> and for all the mighty acts of power and terrifying deeds that Moses performed in the sight of all Israel. </span>\n  </p>\n"]
