["<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith of God’s elect and their knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness, <sup>2</sup> in the hope of eternal life that God, who cannot lie, promised before time began. <sup>3</sup> In his own time he has revealed his word in the preaching with which I was entrusted by the command of God our </span>\n    <del>Savior</del>\n    <ins>Saviour</ins>\n    <span>: <sup>4</sup> To Titus, my true son in our common faith. Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our </span>\n    <del>Savior</del>\n    <ins>Saviour</ins>\n    <span>. <sup>5</sup> The reason I left you in Crete was to set right what was left undone and, as I directed you, to appoint elders in every town. <sup>6</sup> An elder must be blameless, the husband of one wife, with faithful children who are not accused of wildness or rebellion. <sup>7</sup> As an overseer of God’s household, he must be blameless, not arrogant, not hot-tempered, not an excessive drinker, not a bully, not greedy for money, <sup>8</sup> but hospitable, loving what is good, sensible, righteous, holy, self-controlled, <sup>9</sup> holding to the faithful message as taught, so that he will be able both to encourage with sound teaching and to refute those who contradict it. <sup>10</sup> For there are many rebellious people, full of empty talk and deception, especially those from the circumcision party. <sup>11</sup> It is necessary to silence them; they are ruining entire households by teaching what they shouldn’t in order to get money dishonestly. <sup>12</sup> One of their very own prophets said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.” <sup>13</sup> This testimony is true. For this reason, rebuke them sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith <sup>14</sup> and may not pay attention to Jewish myths and the commands of people who reject the truth. <sup>15</sup> To the pure, everything is pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; in fact, both their mind and conscience are defiled. <sup>16</sup> They claim to know God, but they deny him by their works. They are detestable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work. </span>\n  </p>\n","<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> But you are to proclaim things consistent with sound teaching. <sup>2</sup> Older men are to be self-controlled, worthy of respect, sensible, and sound in faith, love, and endurance. <sup>3</sup> In the same way, older women are to be reverent in </span>\n    <del>behavior</del>\n    <ins>behaviour</ins>\n    <span>, not slanderers, not slaves to excessive drinking. They are to teach what is good, <sup>4</sup> so that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands and to love their children, <sup>5</sup> to be self-controlled, pure, workers at home, kind, and in submission to their husbands, so that God’s word will not be slandered. <sup>6</sup> In the same way, encourage the young men to be self-controlled <sup>7</sup> in everything. Make yourself an example of good works with integrity and dignity in your teaching. <sup>8</sup> Your message is to be sound beyond reproach, so that any opponent will be ashamed, because he doesn’t have anything bad to say about us. <sup>9</sup> Slaves are to submit to their masters in everything, and to be well-pleasing, not talking back <sup>10</sup> or stealing, but demonstrating utter faithfulness, so that they may adorn the teaching of God our </span>\n    <del>Savior</del>\n    <ins>Saviour</ins>\n    <span> in everything. <sup>11</sup> For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, <sup>12</sup> instructing us to deny godlessness and worldly lusts and to live in a sensible, righteous, and godly way in the present age, <sup>13</sup> while we wait for the blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and </span>\n    <del>Savior</del>\n    <ins>Saviour</ins>\n    <span>, Jesus Christ. <sup>14</sup> He gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to cleanse for himself a people for his own possession, eager to do good works. <sup>15</sup> Proclaim these things; encourage and rebuke with all authority. Let no one disregard you. </span>\n  </p>\n","<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> Remind them to submit to rulers and authorities, to obey, to be ready for every good work, <sup>2</sup> to slander no one, to avoid fighting, and to be kind, always showing gentleness to all people. <sup>3</sup> For we too were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved by various passions and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, detesting one another. <sup>4</sup> But when the kindness of God our </span>\n    <del>Savior</del>\n    <ins>Saviour</ins>\n    <span> and his love for mankind appeared, <sup>5</sup> he saved us </span>\n    <ins>​</ins>\n    <span>— </span>\n    <ins>​</ins>\n    <span>not by works of righteousness that we had done, but according to his mercy ​— ​through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit. <sup>6</sup> He poured out his Spirit on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our </span>\n    <del>Savior</del>\n    <ins>Saviour</ins>\n    <span> <sup>7</sup> so that, having been justified by his grace, we may become heirs with the hope of eternal life. <sup>8</sup> This saying is trustworthy. I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have believed God might be careful to devote themselves to good works. These are good and profitable for everyone. <sup>9</sup> But avoid foolish debates, genealogies, quarrels, and disputes about the law, because they are unprofitable and worthless. <sup>10</sup> Reject a divisive person after a first and second warning. <sup>11</sup> For you know that such a person has gone astray and is sinning; he is self-condemned. <sup>12</sup> When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make every effort to come to me in Nicopolis, because I have decided to spend the winter there. <sup>13</sup> Diligently help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey, so that they will lack nothing. <sup>14</sup> Let our people learn to devote themselves to good works for pressing needs, so that they will not be unfruitful. <sup>15</sup> All those who are with me send you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with all of you. </span>\n  </p>\n"]
