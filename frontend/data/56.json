["<p>\n    <span> <sup>1</sup> Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother: To Philemon our dear friend and </span>\n    <del>coworker</del>\n    <ins>co-worker</ins>\n    <span>, <sup>2</sup> to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church that meets in your home. <sup>3</sup> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. <sup>4</sup> I always thank my God when I mention you in my prayers, <sup>5</sup> because I hear of your love for all the saints and the faith that you have in the Lord Jesus. <sup>6</sup> I pray that your participation in the faith may become effective through knowing every good thing that is in us for the glory of Christ. <sup>7</sup> For I have great joy and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother. <sup>8</sup> For this reason, although I have great boldness in Christ to command you to do what is right, <sup>9</sup> I appeal to you, instead, on the basis of love. I, Paul, as an elderly man and now also as a prisoner of Christ Jesus, <sup>10</sup> appeal to you for my son, Onesimus. I became his father while I was in chains. <sup>11</sup> Once he was useless to you, but now he is useful both to you and to me. <sup>12</sup> I am sending him back to you ​— ​I am sending my very own heart. <sup>13</sup> I wanted to keep him with me, so that in my imprisonment for the gospel he might serve me in your place. <sup>14</sup> But I didn’t want to do anything without your consent, so that your good deed might not be out of obligation, but of your own free will. <sup>15</sup> For perhaps this is why he was separated from you for a brief time, so that you might get him back permanently, <sup>16</sup> no longer as a slave, but more than a slave ​— ​as a dearly loved brother. He is especially so to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. <sup>17</sup> So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would me. <sup>18</sup> And if he has wronged you in any way, or owes you anything, charge that to my account. <sup>19</sup> I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it ​— ​not to mention to you that you owe me even your very self. <sup>20</sup> Yes, brother, may I benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ. <sup>21</sup> Since I am confident of your obedience, I am writing to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say. <sup>22</sup> Meanwhile, also prepare a guest room for me, since I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you. <sup>23</sup> Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings, and so do <sup>24</sup> Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my </span>\n    <del>coworkers</del>\n    <ins>co-workers</ins>\n    <span>. <sup>25</sup> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. </span>\n  </p>\n"]
